    <section id="problem">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>The first step is always to identify the problem. I promise to stop the “This Is Sri Lanka” Cult. The criminal enemy must be brought to justice. When you are considering political options: always look at how accurately they identify, describe and propose to solve the problems they find for you.</p>

    <section id="budget">
        <h2>Budget</h2>
        <p>How we plan on allocating your taxpayer budget for 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029. This is around $12b per year x 5 years = $60b dollars over our term in office. Although, with new taxes: we expect this to be $20b+ per year. I also explain why we have a few pre-approved items to purchase for you. I also explain how this helps you.</p>

    <section id="treasure">
        <h2>Treasure</h2>
        <p>We will earn for you with 10% of incomes. The world leaders in the field will run these. We’ll invest and you’ll earn ~ $350 per year. I think we could probably operate these businesses to earn Sri Lanka Citizens (especially, our poor) and PRs and foreign investors larger returns.</p>
