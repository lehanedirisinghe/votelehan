        <section id="iran-intro">
            <h1>Iran</h1>
        
            <h2>Hidden Oil Purchases</h2>
            <p>We have been losing over $1 billion dollars to Iran every year to purchase oil for a long time. </p>
            <p>This staggering sum of money is hidden by Sri Lanka’s government citing “national interest”. You won’t find it in the public finances. </p>
            <p>However, it’s well known that Iran is the only supplier of oil. We don’t buy from Saudis or UAE. This should reveal to you the scale of theft ongoing.</p> 
            <p>Iran escape sanctions by using Singapore to re-sell "blood oil" (homogenous) with a little processing.</p>
            <p>Iran venomously support Islam's Jihad interpretation based terror attacks globally.</p>
            
            <p>I don't like Iran's complicity in refusing to report these funds in our public finances. </p>
            <p> Moslems value honesty, and we want to try to aspire to those ideals in our dealings. </p>

            <h2>Nuclear Threats by Iran</h2>
            <p>The majority of Iranian representatives in their parliament angrily vow to use nuclear weapons on Israel. </p>
            <p>This was after Trump ordered a drone strike to kill Qasem Soleimani. Trump complained "disloyal" Bibi or Benjamin Netanyahu had backed out of this drone strike. </p>
            <p>Iran often spreads anti-semitism in Sri Lanka as they arm Hamas to murder Israeli civilians.</p>
            <p>While several nations refuse ties with Iran after such North Korean-like declarations. We tolerate it as they were angry, reacting emotionally after a killing.</p> 
            <p>It is wise to avoid straining diplomatic ties, possibly with cancelling ongoing transactions, expelling diplomats and deport all of Iran's citizens visiting Sri Lanka. </p>
            <p>We will do so if they try to attack any innocent civilians or tourists or places of worship here.</p>
            <p> We will keep this ban until we are voted out.</p>
            
            <h2>Iran Spreads Anti-Semitism</h2>
            <p>Our 2 to 3 million Sunni mostly-Wahhabi Muslims are a strong part of our identity.</p>
            <p>Saudi Arabia's moderate House of Saud and orthodox Wahabis work together to build their future. </p>
            <p>Iranians follow a minority Shia version of Islam which our locals don't accept.</p>
            <p>Moslems in Sri Lanka mostly hold Israel in contempt over perceived injustices against Palestinians. </p>
            <p>We don't want Iran's dangerous anti-semitism causing tragedies here when Moslems live in harmony with us.</p>
            <p>My police will investigate incitement as it's a serious crime to instruct, justify and support.</p>

            
            <h2>Public Finances Stolen for Terrorism</h2>
            <p>The hidden billions of dollars over decades for Iran's oil goes to local representatives.</p>
            <p>Extremists loyal to Iran use this as a “black budget” to be used by terrorists. </p>
            <p>It’s likely this is how the Easter Sunday Terror Attacks in 2019 on April 21st were financed.</p>
            <p>Zahran's terrorist cell used high-tech equipment, explosives and methods of carrying this out.</p>
            <p>Zahran Hashim’s imported spices such as Iran’s saffron, so they have contacts to do so.</p>
            <p>It’s easy to launder this to avoid terrorist investigations and financial intelligence on money trails. </p>
            <p>It’s likely a black budget, like a CIA black budget for wetwork, is used to stage protests against Israel in front of the UN frequently.</p>
            <p> Or even to protest against the UK or the US as the Iran government hates the US equally.</p>
            <p>Our advanced financial forensics capabilities are deployed to uncover money trails behind sedition or terrorist event staging efforts which we act on.</p>
            <p> Most of this is kept hidden, as we want to preserve our sophisticated info gathering capacities as secrets. </p>
            <p>Dinesh Schaffter's murder was easy to figure out, but we can't reveal how we know what happened. It's a nightmare to prosecute, as we can't show the proof.</p>
            <p> However we can make sure justice is delivered. We have to share reports on Iran's efforts here with our security partners, but will be forced to take harsh diplomatic action.</p>
            <p>While we respect Islam, adherents must not let their Jihadi passions run wild here. </p>

            <p>Islam's held as a faith, as a final testament of G-d's will, by 1 in 4 people: 2 billion out of 8.</p> 
            <p>We don't like it when our Moslems friends are blamed for barbaric acts by a few. </p>
            <h2>2019 April 21 Deliberate Failures</h2>
            <p>Israel's Mossad (foreign intelligence service) and Israeli Embassy in Sri Lanka operate out of the Indian High Commission which is next to the US embassy in Sri Lanka in front of Temple Trees. </p>
            <p>They observed, then reported on this imminent terrorist attack to India’s Research and Analysis Wing ("RAW"). As they are watching Iran’s activity closely.</p>
            <p>RAW provided multiple written warnings using multiple official channels to Maithripala Sirisena, the then president and minister of defence. </p>
            <p>Despite following protocols and procedures in making requests, providing multiple written warnings of imminent terror attacks, and working hard to stop this threat, no action was taken.</p>
            <p> In fact, our sources say to me that the police were ordered to stand down and stop the Sufis, when Sufi (spiritual Islam) adherents fought with Zahran themselves. </p>
            <p> Zahran clearly says he’s part of Jihad, vowed with his sick partners oaths to do it on YouTube videos, and kept saying he’d carry out Jihad. </p>
            <p> Sri Lanka Police are part of the Ministry of Defence, they report to defense minister Sirisena. </p>
            <p>This written evidence has also been seen by the entire defence ministry, the courts, and certain individuals.</p>
            <p>Such proof is the only reason why Sirisena’s been found guilty of negligence by Sri Lanka Courts. However, all the evidence hasn’t been released to the public.</p>
            <p>We will force the payment of damages to the victims.</p>
            <p>I was aggrieved to see on BBC News that many Moslems were attacked, shops were damaged and so many were reduced to Zahran's status unfairly as a repercussion of this injustice. </p>
            <p>We center our political campaign on positive traits of our vision, developing to first world status and solving our worst problems as a society.</p>
            <p> We don't want to stoop to deriding villagers as terrorist collaborators for concocting conspiracies to murder our own people to divide us as enemies.</p>
            
            <h2>Justice for 4/21 Victims</h2>
            <p>I promise to publish these warnings for the public, ask Modi and Jaishankar to inform our public of the steps they took to warn Sirisena personally, and then bring Sirisena to justice for 4/21. </p>
            <p>I’m ashamed most of all, that my country Sri Lanka let down such wealthy foreigners visiting Sri Lanka in this way. The Kingdom of Denmark’s richest man Ander Povlsen’s lost 3 out of his 7 children. </p>
            <p>After many years, Sirisena was only asked to pay a fine of $250,000 dollars to the 270 victim’s families.</p> 
            <p>Sirisena’s humiliated the victims further by saying that he’s got no money. Despite getting a criminal bribe of $295 million as “a gift” from China in exchange for likely approving shady deals.</p>
            <p>It's heart-breaking to see salt rubbed into the painful wounds inflicted on our people on Easter Sunday when Jesus rose from the dead.</p>
        
            <h2>Sirisena Backed by Deepa</h2>
            <p>Sirisena’s attracted disgraced thieves like Deepa Edirisinghe to support his politics. </p> 
            <p>Deepa was an ETI Finance director, who with her brothers Jeewaka, Nalaka and Asanka, defrauded close to $100 million with a Ponzi scheme from close to 20,000 to 35,000 depositors. </p>
            <p>They have thus far, "cooperated" with local authorities to avoid returning funds, which likely went to beneficiaries like their kids overseas, but we will bring them to justice.</p>
            <p>Trust us on this: we know all about these types of thieves, their lies, and will make sure they will not be able to escape with what they stole.</p>
