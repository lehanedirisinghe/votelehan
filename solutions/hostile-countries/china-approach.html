        <section id="china-intro">
            <h2>China</h2>
            <h2>Economic Drain</h2>
            <p>China earn $6 billion dollars from Sri Lanka per year. This money is wiped off our GDP, we become more indebted and struggle to survive.</p>
            <p> They’re planning out and threatening to invade Taiwan. China is also sponsoring North Korea.</p>
            
            <p>China should have invested in pig farms! Rather than this, they paid for Rajapaksa's campaigns where he played this hardcore Sinhalese buddhist strongman. Only to betray us as a nation by signing loss making deals. We want to do business with the second most important economic powerhouse. We have many Chinese friends. It's worth doing it right. China is a friend to us, who have invested in areas, when nobody else would. Even if they were not feasible, and should not have done so. We will be ready to honor sensible deals, offer up good opportunity for investing and respond to any requests with courage. While we might be pro-US, we are still respecting China's contributions to our nation.</p>

            <h2>Chinese Election Interference</h2>
            <p>China paid millions of dollars for the elections campaigns of Mahinda Rajapaksa, Maithripala Sirisena, and Gotabaya. China paid for the elections, then paid many millions of dollars in bribes in exchange for signing loss-making deals. These were not feasible deals that they paid bribes to sign.</p>
            <p>They have to be held responsible for this, as the relationships of complicity here revealing. They need to cooperate with us on criminal investigations, especially to verify documents, substantiate evidence and share perspectives on these dealings. While we respect Xi Jinping for treasuring the trust his friends place in him, especially in secret. We are keen on becoming a high-trust society who have free, open and frank dialogues, especially in top level, state to state business dealings. We can't proceed any further if there is criminal conduct ("illegal lobbying"), have to disqualify or suspend such projects and hold the Chinese government responsible for violating the sanctity of international trade. This may have spillover consequences for the Belt and Road Initiative, at a time when China owes a lot of debt internally, which can result in a loss of face. </p>
        
            <h2>Dishonest Traps</h2>
            <p>No other creditors or countries wished to bet on these loans as they’re simply not feasible. To mitigate the risk, they charged high interest rates, stipulated we pay only Chinese companies with these loans, buy Chinese materials, and also repay the funds in a short term. These were not feasible deals that they paid bribes to sign. They knew this harbor in Hambantota would fail, so they paid bribes to sign it, so we would incur losses, and hand it over to China.</p>
            <p>This is not cool. The people of Sri Lanka are being asked to make a serious decision as a nation on whether they wish to continue down this pathway to losses. We are still happy to do business with China, but only if it's profitable, sustainable and conducted in good conscience.</p>


            <h2>Chinese Belt and Road</h2>
            <p>The entire Belt and Road initiative has been built on paying bribes to corrupt decision-makers. All the Belt and Road member countries have extremely bad reputations. All of China’s partner countries score very poorly in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.</p>
            <p>This is quite sad. We don't want to lose China as a friend, but if they don't get it together, we will be happy to cut our losses, and leave them in the past.</p>
            
            <p>Almost all of these countries, caught in this “debt-trap,” are now having serious problems. They are often giving up assets they built with these loans but remain in more debt. This is easy to understand. The reason it’s done is because China bribed very corrupt traitors into deliberately betraying the country.</p>
            <p>So for instance, if they borrow $5 billion to build a port at $4 billion, as they think it will earn $1 billion per year, then they must repay the $5 billion. But if the port doesn’t earn, then they will give this to China as collateral to earn $1 billion instead. But they must still somehow pay $5 billion back to China without the $4 billion port that earns $1 billion per year. Which is absurd.</p>
            <p>Again: the only reason it’s been signed is because of criminal bribes.</p>
            
            <h2>Pariah Country Schemes</h2>
            <p>These pariah status nations often take efforts to provide school curriculums, weapons, or tech. Even in the US, Russia is famous for planting deep undercover moles to try to steal secrets. China uses weather balloons to steal signals intelligence in the US.</p>
            <p>The enemy conditions or grooms Sri Lanka to do business with China, Russia, or Iran and reject the US or UK. This is by playing on xenophobic themes such as whites are bad, or that the colonial era was bad.</p>
            <p>We don't want to continue these wicked plots to dupe our people into making the worst of their lives. We want to get along with people, living in the here and now. We see China's rise as a strength, and any failure, be it Xi's fall from grace, Belt and Road's collapse or Chinese people suffering as "bad news" for all of us too. China has contributed a stabilizing presence in Asia, which we admire.</p>
            
            <h2>Chinese Spying</h2>
            <p>I think that the telecommunications equipment supplied to Sri Lanka by China for very low cost is to try to spy on civilians. Huawei and ZTE were banned in the US and the UK. Even TikTok isn’t allowed to be used now by US government employees.</p>
            <p>I think that the Sri Lanka military communications platform is provided by China for free. This is in fact treason, as it’s espionage and allowed exfiltration of state secrets to a foreign power, not known by the general public and not acceptable in any other country. It’s all the more disgusting because of how our people’s fundamental rights to privacy are violated by foreign pariah states.</p>
            
            <p>We have a responsibility to people who trust us, to deliver safe comms to them. We don't want any more funny business in our backyard.</p>
            <p> This is our Sri Lanka's backyard, not China's or America's. As our ally, the US has disgracefully spied on their own citizens unlawfully for security. We're trying to do it right. We are using sensible equipment, protocols and methods. </p>
            
        
            <h2>Supporting Mistakes</h2>
            <p>When Sri Lankan side politicians make such statements, they appear to represent “The Republic of Sri Lanka” when they say so. So, if the president of Sri Lanka, they represent the people of the country when condemning the US. This is an unsustainable strategy by China.</p>
            <p>Our people can see through this, media literacy has been hard earned by us and they are not as tolerant now.</p>
