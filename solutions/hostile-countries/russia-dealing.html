            <h1>Russia</h1>
        
            <h2>Losses to Russia</h2>
            <p>Sri Lanka loses $2 billion to Russia per year.</p>
            <p>I would love to see transparency on public finance dealings, so our two peoples can freely do honest business. </p>
            <p>I'm opposed to secretive Sri Lanka government to Russian state-owned business deals. </p>
            <p>While few Putin-loyal Russian oligarchs own more than 80% of Russia's people. This is happening in every nation. Communism doesn't equalize wealth disparities.</p>
            <p>80% of the new wealth under Modi went to 20 firms who maintain close ties with his gov't.</p>
            <p>We see through the fog of west vs east propaganda, are serious and do no-nonsense business with an open mind.</p>
        
            <h2>Bullying Ukraine</h2>
            <p>Russia invaded smaller Ukraine. This is saddening to see. Many European nations, led by the US, have sanctioned Russia. I read Russia's gold deposits in UK were frozen. </p>
            <p>Russia worries US-controlled Ukraine poses a threat, as America can invade, fly in bombers, spy, fire artillery, etc.</p>
            <p>So they are trying to take over Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Ukraine was part of the USSR. The "soviet" in Putin sees resource-rich Ukraine as part of their old Russia.</p> 
            <p>I saw Wagner's Yevgeny Prigozhin, candidate Alexey Navalny and several more deaths on the news.</p>
            <p>We wish to look past all this for the sake of a future peace. </p>
            <p> Germans are now one of Israel's closest allies. Mikey Federmann at Elbit has German engineering partners. </p>
            <p>Poor Sri Lankans enlist in both Ukraine and Russia as soldiers for hire. I see a lot of good Russian blood drawn.</p>

            <h2>Russian Patrons</h2>
            <p>Russia are friends with respected local decision makers. </p>
            <p>They sign deals.for MiG aircraft, weapons, coal, etc.</p>
            <p>Lasantha was murdered according to his daughter over the forced MiG 27 deal with 100% marked up prices.</p>
            <p>We don't want poor portrayals over Lasantha: traitor, Chris Morris, BBC interview taken down, lawsuit for defamation, white flags, Gota ordered it, etc.</p>
            <p>coal is sold at huge mark-ups, at some of the highest pricest in the world, and at expense to the Sri Lankan taxpayer, as it's SL government to government-owned business.</p>
            <p>Eastern Europeans working as sex workers here, can do so only if they do it independently.</p>
            <p>Our police will regulate sex industry to rescue trafficked girls and prosecute foreign instigators.</p> 
            <p>We like OnlyFans who help sex workers earn 80%. </p>
            <p>We want to do ethical business, where these things are done openly, with public confidence.</p>



            <h2>Murdering Journalists</h2>
            <p>Lasantha's murder was likely committed by Gota, although, it's hard to prove it for a lack of evidence.</p>
            <p>The hitmen thought they were loyalist patriots bravely following special orders to stop a traitor trying to betray Sri Lanka's sovereignity.</p>
            <p>They felt Lasantha and Frederica Jansz were trying sabotage, guilty of treason and consorted with designated terrorists to betray our people.</p> 
            <p>When asked by reporters, Gotabaya has also mockingly laughed that "Sarath Fonseka has done it." </p>
            <p>Amjad Moulana has claimed Tripoli Platoon was behind it, although as a former terrorist, his claims are likely dubious, or he is trying to get attention or payment.</p>
            <p>I saw China or Russia eager to defend Gota afterwards as we "are a sovereign republic" by asking the US to "stop interfering in our domestic affairs".</p>
            <p>We want to move forward as allies who are a good influence on each other.</p>

            <h2>Corrupting Defence Ministry</h2>
            <p>Defense industry is corrupt area in any state.</p>
            <p>“National security” is claimed to hide or cover up deals as a “military secret”. Purchases are hidden.</p> 
            <p>Construction, engineering or real-estate is also dodgy as it's speculation driven and costing estimates are subjective.</p>
            <p>My Defense Department will be managed with utmost transparency, while preserving our troop training, tactics and movements strategy secrets.</p>
            <p> We use transparent systems to make theft impossible, no longer fashionable or acceptable as our people prefer a new, realistic and healthy way of doing things.</p>


            
            <h2>Danger with Russia</h2>
            <p>Russia spread contempt against America. </p> 
            <p>China on Weibo offer options like "US interferes, causes problems everywhere”. </p>
            <p>This is used to disqualify the US in many business dealings or public tenders unfairly.</p>
            <p>We want to have a level-playing field, to benefit SL as a non-aligned nation, as opposed to be disadvantage by being caught in between their ideological disputes.</p>
            <p>We don't want spying on or sabotaging foreign communications to exfiltrate conversations, signals intelligence or sensitive data to take place here.</p>
        
            <p>Putin's a good leader of his people. We're happy to show our respect to his Russian people, by doing honest business. This means if there is a competitive proposal for buying coal, at good rates which make sense, we're happy to do so. </p>
            <p>Russia is welcome to propose bids for our nuclear powerplant plans like everyone else.</p>
            <p>If they are winning on merit, which other nations cannot compete and beat, we'll go with them. </p>
            <p>We enjoy long-standing, overwhelmingly positive relationships with Russia, let's stay away from criminal conduct and build on our good-will as allies.</p>
