    <h1>The Problem</h1>
    <p>The big problem for Sri Lanka is the: “This Is Sri Lanka Cult”.</p>

    <p>This evil group is led by gangsters who fund politicians. The enemy claim to be part of, and promote, a corrupted, harmful version of Theravada Buddhism. They systematically harm the innocent, young, foreigners, minorities, and women.</p>
    
    <h3>Misguided Democracy</h3>
    <p>Yes. Sri Lanka’s kleptocracy gives you two options. This is either: a communist oligarchy or crony capitalism. These are your only options. You must suck up to the criminal higher ups, make friends with and beg for favors. This is the only way to get a job, get anything done or to succeed here in Sri Lanka.</p>
    
    <h3>Wasted Elections</h3>
    <p>Yes. We have elections every 5 years. We see capitalists and socialists switch seats. But our country always loses. It’s like musical chairs, a merry-go-round.</p>   
    
    <p>WWThis destroys the respect people have for democracy. As it clearly doesn’t work. These politicians don’t know political economic theories. Ranil’s UNP, Sirisena’s SLFP, Sajith’s SJB or Gotabaya’s SLPP: they’re colluding as friends. They have each other’s backs. They’re as thick as thieves. You see how friendly they are with each other.</p>

    <p>When you read or listen to the politicians, they never discuss the serious problems we face. You see how little intelligence they possess.
    </p>
    
    <p>WThere’s no basic accountability for budget expenses, decisions or governmental performance. These criminals depend on our people being poor, needing their help or being left in the dark to control them. As they only have power if they can extort votes.</p>    
    
    <p>WOften the political parties exist only to divide and confuse the voters.</p>
