            <h1>Dying Sinhalese</h1>
        
            <h2>A Nation in Misery</h2>
            <p>I am saddened to see that our Sinhalese people are predominantly miserable, living in poverty, or leading very painful lives. We have become servants or beggars in our own homeland.</p>
            <p>This dire situation has arisen due to horrendous leadership by our Sinhalese leaders, who have failed to ensure that our own people can partake in growth or achieve success.</p>
        
            <h2>Contrast with Other Communities</h2>
            <p>This is not the way other races, such as Jews, look out for one another. They thrive on mutual support and solidarity. In contrast, many of our people today work as servants or slaves in foreign countries like Saudi Arabia or the UAE, highlighting our desperation and lack of opportunities.</p>
        
            <h2>Physical and Economic Weakness</h2>
            <p>Our people are generally physically weaker due to a severe shortage of food in Sri Lanka, a consequence of improper national planning, lack of economic opportunity, and poor decision-making during elections. Voters often do not demand or approve specific plans on how Sri Lanka should conduct business, leading to disastrous results.</p>
        
            <h2>Betrayal and Jealousy</h2>
            <p>There is a tendency among our people to betray, lie to, or cheat each other. Instead of uplifting one another, we are eager to pull each other down, reveling in others' failures. While it's justified to criticize businesses committing serious crimes, the attacks often stem from jealousy and pettiness.</p>
        
            <h2>Culture of Abuse and Emotional Unhygiene</h2>
            <p>There is a deeply ingrained, ugly, and sickening culture of emotionally unhygienic abuse, characterized by overstepping personal boundaries and perpetuating abuse. Child abuse is rampant among Sinhalese families, with canes being sold on the streets to parents who destroy children's self-esteem early on. This results in adults with low confidence, insecurity, and damaged, borderline personality traits.</p>
        
            <h2>Unrealistic Expectations and Toxic Relationships</h2>
            <p>The Sinhalese also tend to have very unrealistic expectations of each other within the community. They expect others to behave in certain ways or tolerate serious mistakes. For instance, if someone spends money on a movie or time with you as a friend, they expect you to forgive severe transgressions like violent assaults, which is unhealthy.</p>
            <p>There is a lot of Bollywood-style drama that adds to the trauma, with people making serious mistakes and expecting forgiveness without accountability.</p>
        
            <h2>Need for Strong Sinhalese Leadership</h2>
            <p>Sri Lanka's Sinhalese people desperately need a leader who understands these issues and can guide the community towards a more realistic state of social appropriateness. A leader who can address these deeply rooted problems and foster a culture of mutual respect and support is crucial for our survival and prosperity.</p>
        
            <h2>Loser Reputation</h2>
            <p>Sri Lanka has failed in every performance measure. Whether it's Quality of Life, Standard of Living, Economic Growth, Ease of Doing Business, or any other metric, we are at the bottom. This loser reputation is something we must change by addressing the root causes of our failures and working together for a better future.</p>
