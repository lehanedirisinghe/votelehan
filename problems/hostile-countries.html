            <h1>Hostile Countries</h1>
        
            <h2>Pariah States</h2>
            <p>Russia, Iran, and China.</p>
        
            <h2>Foreign Threats We Face</h2>
            <p>Sri Lankans are unlucky that pariah states have long-term plans to harm us. These pariah nations have committed war crimes, fraud, and terrorism.</p>
            
            <h2>Bad Influence</h2>
            <p>When you are often the average of your top 5 friends you hang out with, it’s obviously very unhealthy for us to be buddies with these three pariah states. We also learn many bad habits from them. They enable us to commit atrocities as a bad influence.</p>
            <p>Due to social failures, Sri Lanka was at one point friendly with Iraq, who were our biggest buyer of tea. The evil culture permeating has led to us befriending the wrong people.</p>
        
            <h2>Impunity Culture</h2>
            <p>I believe we even adopted our culture of impunity from these pariah states. We are also often held guilty by association by the international community. I’ve seen China try to coax or goad Sri Lanka onto China’s side by pretending to side with us on war crimes issues. This kind of tactic does work, so they do it regularly.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="russia-intro">
  
            <h1>Russia</h1>
        
            <h2>Losses to Russia</h2>
            <p>We lose approximately $2 billion to Russia every year.</p>
            <p class="solution">This trade deficit isn't the end of the world, it's not all about money. However we would love to see transparency on these dealings, so our people can honest business freely with the people of Russia. While just 1,000 of Russia's oligarchs own more wealth than 80% of Russia's people. This is a common phenomenon in every nation. We are happy to see through the west vs east propaganda, act serious and do business with an open mind.</p>
        
            <h2>Bullying Ukraine</h2>
            <p>Russia invaded Ukraine illegally, after lying they wouldn’t. They see us as a military base to make use of. They’re desperate to get rid of the US.</p>

            <p class="solution">The whole world has seemingly sanctioned Russia and Putin's close friends. Yet as they are built as a superpower, they have been able to push through. We don't think invading countries, shelling civilian sites, is acceptable. However, I see that Ukraine was part of the USSR, which is how the Soviet in Putin still sees his Russian empire. While Yevgeny Prigozhin in the Wagner, presidential candidate Alexey Navalny and several enemies of Putin have been suspiciously murdered. We still wish to look past this for the sake of a future peace. The Germans are today some of Israel's closest allies. We want to make some real peace happen free of enmity. It's sad we saw Sri Lankans enlist in both Ukraine and Russia as soldiers. We similarly see some of the finest Russian genetic stock wasted with tears.</p>
            
            <h2>Russian Patrons</h2>
            <p>Russia uses expensive patrons who are decision-makers to sign corrupt deals. These are criminal deals for MiG fighter aircrafts, weapon deals, coal imports, and even prostitution rackets. We saw Eastern European girls trafficked to Sri Lanka to forcibly work as indentured sex workers.</p>
        
            <p class="solution">We don't tolerate corruption. As a fail-safe, perfect and airtight solution to betrayal of public trust, we will use radical transparency in all our dealings. The 100% marked up, criminal MiG 27 deal by Gota, which led to Lasantha Wickrematunge's murder on 2009 January 8th according to his daughter Ahimsa, has been a compounding tragedy. The disgrace on our people, who were misled that Lasantha's a traitor over "white flags" or "Gota ordered it", has been a constantly running theme in many portrayals of our people. The Chris Morris interview with Gota on BBC News was taken down after intense lobbying. We want to move ahead without such shameful conduct. Our police will intervene in our sex industry to make sure to rescue trafficked girls. We are making sure if there is lawful sex services sold, then this is only through independent, lawful and trained professionals. They must be paid for their work which they earned: like Only Fans, where they collect a minor commission. We can't allow criminal pimps, sex trafficking racketeers or disturbed gangsters with close association with regional governments orchestrate rape for pay. Please don't try it unless you want the horrifying evidence shared online, newspaper articles printed and humiliating criminal prosection carried out which will lead to a termination of diplomatic relations with us.</p>

            <h2>Murdering Journalists</h2>
            <p>Many journalists have sadly been murdered for reporting on these serious crimes. Often journalists are shamefully killed for stating facts, professional opinions (totally objective), or for simply copying government Gazette notifications published by the state officials themselves regarding such deals.</p>

            <p class="solution">Again, while there have been zero arrests regarding Lasantha's ghastly murder. We all can guess who has done it. The likely culprit has claimed to his loyalists he protected Sri Lanka's sovereignity, as Lasantha and even Frederica had attempted to conduct sabotage, treason and consorted with designated terrorists to betray our people. When asked by reporters, Gotabaya has also mockingly laughed that "Sarath Fonseka has done it." We just don't want any more violence to take place. It's our duty as leaders to solve cases, bring criminals to justice and keep our people feeling safe. The press here will be given the freedom to report anything as they wish. We just wish to warn any foreign powers, that the menacing tone of intimidating our people's eyes and ears through local thug proxies, jumping to defend them afterwards as we/ SL "are a sovereign republic" and asking the US or caring observers to "stop interfering in SL's domestic affairs" has to stop. We want to move forward as allies who are a good influence on each other.</p>
            
            <h2>Corrupting Defence Ministry</h2>
            <p>In any country, the most corrupt area is often defense. This is because you can claim it’s for “national security” to hide or cover up a “military secret”. This means that any purchases are hidden. I think that construction or engineering is the second most corrupt area because costing estimates are subjective. This is followed by technology, banking, and cyber, as they relate to final pricing.</p>
            <p class="solution">We will make sure our Defense Department is managed with utmost transparency, while preserving our secrets on troop training, tactics and movements strategy. We will put in place new systems that make theft impossible, or no longer fashionable or acceptable to a people longing to get used to a new, realistic and healthy way of doing things.</p>

            
            <h2>Danger with Russia</h2>
            <p>Russia is dangerous as they advise their patrons to spread disgust for the US, they often advise assassinations of journalists and rush to justify such crimes. China has provided snide options on Weibo, such as “The US interferes, causes problems everywhere”. Russia also promotes such rhetoric. This is often used to disqualify the US in many business dealings or public tenders unfairly.</p>

            <p class="solution">Over here, it's fine with us if they wish to spread dissent. They know we can't stop them. But we don't want those regional wars finding their way into our home turf. This means no spying on or sabotaging foreign communications to exfiltrate conversations, signals intelligence or sensitive data. We want an open, and level playing field. </p>

        
            <h2>Dishonest Russian Deals</h2>
            <p> The coal is often marked up by 100% before being sold to Sri Lanka. This is likely the highest price any country pays for coal imports. There’s absolutely no transparency on these dealings or purchases even though these are all taxpayer-funded.</p>

            <p class="solution">Putin's a good leader of his people. We're happy to show our respect to his Russian people, by doing honest business. This means if there is a competitive proposal for buying coal, at good rates which make sense, we're happy to do so. But no shady Russian nuclear powerplant company executives trying to play games. We want to do all of it openly, and if they have merits, which other nations cannot compete and beat, we'll go with them. We have had a long-standing, overwhelmingly positive relationship with Russia, we want to do away with any criminal conduct and want build on this good-will earned as allies.</p>
        </section>
        

        <section id="iran-intro">
            <h1>Iran</h1>
        
            <h2>Hidden Oil Purchases</h2>
            <p>We lose over $1 billion dollars to Iran every year to purchase oil. This large sum of money is often hidden by Sri Lanka’s government citing “national interest”. You won’t find it in the public finances. However, it’s well known that Iran is the only supplier of oil. We don’t buy from Saudis or UAE. To escape or avoid international sanctions placed on Iran, Iran will often use Singapore to sell oil products. As oil is a mostly homogenous product, it’s easy for them to do so, especially with processing. Iran is very dangerous as they regularly support Islamic terrorism internationally.</p>
            

            <p class="solution">We are happy to do business with Iran. A long time ago, Iraq was our biggest purchaser of tea. We just want to know that it's not blood oil, as we prefer a good name over good oil. While it's fair to blame SL's government for the failures to report purchases of oil. We can't tolerate this, and the knowing complicity of Iran's regime in doing so. While it's understandable they will dodge US sanctions, using Singapore's port too. The US says they give "official" forgiveness notes when nations buy it. They were angry India was buying Russia's gas too. We still want to know that we are getting a good deal, without any remorse over the details. A blood diamond is not as valued as a close enough identical stone which is legal. The Moslem people of Iran, seem to value human spiritual growth, which we also want to prioritze, especially in good dealings. </p>

            <h2>Nuclear Threats by Iran</h2>
            <p>Iran’s parliament unanimously promises to use nuclear weapons on Israel. This was after Trump ordered a drone strike to kill Qasem Soleimani. Iran often spreads anti-semitism in Sri Lanka as they arm Hamas to murder Israeli civilians.</p>
            <p class="solution">It's a shocker how any country could maintain ties with Iran after such declarations. They are like North Korea. However, we will tolerate it as they were angry. Just please note we will cancel diplomatic ties and immediately deport all of Iran's people living in SL if they try to attack any innocent civilians or tourists or places of worship here. We will keep this ban order up until our time in office runs out.</p>
            
            <h2>Iran Spreads Anti-Semitism</h2>
            <p>Our country has close to 2 million Muslims. Most of our Muslims follow Sunni Islam. There is an extremist form of Sunni known as Wahhabi. In Saudi Arabia, the Wahabis keep the House of Saud in power. The House of Saud is a largely secular group headed by Prince Salman who are reform or moderate Muslims. They keep the extremists around. The Iranians follow Shia Islam. The contempt towards Israel over Palestine found in Sri Lanka usually stems from Iran. This takes the form of widespread anti-semitism which isn’t found elsewhere.</p>
            <p class="solution">This is a serious crime which our police have to investigate. Please do not pass instructions, justify or support any kinds of violence in SL. While it's sad there is ongoing strife in Israel, and there is widespread animosity amongst our Moslems against Israel, or even Jews. We don't want those problems to spread here as these are minority groups who have been living in peace for decades in SL, like in Singapore. </p>
            
            <h2>Public Finances Stolen for Terrorism</h2>
            <p>Iran has been Sri Lanka’s supplier of crude oil for a long time. But this isn’t reported in public finances anywhere. This money is suspiciously hidden. It’s billions of dollars. It goes to local agents who represent Iran. This money is likely kept hidden in Sri Lanka by extremists loyal to Iran in a “black budget” to be used by terrorists. It’s very likely this is how the Easter Sunday Terror Attacks in 2019 on April 21st were paid for and carried out. It was understood they had high-tech equipment, explosives, and methods of carrying this out. Zahran Hashim’s been involved in imported spices such as Iran’s saffron. It’s easy to launder this to avoid terrorist investigations and financial intelligence on money trails. It’s likely that the black budget, like a CIA black budget, is used to stage protests against Israel in front of the UN from time to time. Or even to protest against the UK or the US as the Iran government hates the US equally.</p>
            <p class="solution">We do have advanced financial forensics capabilities which we deploy to uncover money trails behind sedition or terrorist event staging efforts. Most of this is kept hidden, as we want to preserve our sophisticated info gathering capacities as secrets. Dinesh Schaffter's murder was easy to figure out, but we can't reveal how we know what happened. It's a nightmare to prosecute, as we can't show the proof. However we can make sure justice is delivered. We have to share reports on Iran's efforts here with our security partners, but will be forced to take harsh diplomatic action if they try to let their passions run wild here in their overly tolerant interpretation of extremist Jihad. Islam's held as a faith, as a final testament of G-d's will, by 1 in 4 people. We don't like it when our Moslem friends have to defend the barbaric acts of a few claiming to be Muhammad. </p>
            
            <h2>2019 April 21 Deliberate Failures</h2>
            <p>In my opinion, the Israeli Mossad (foreign intelligence service) and Israeli Embassy in Sri Lanka operate out of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka. They have observed, then reported on this imminent terrorist attack to India’s Research and Analysis Wing. As they are watching Iran’s activity closely. RAW had provided multiple written warnings using multiple official channels to Maithripala Sirisena, the then president and minister of defence. Despite following protocols and procedures in making requests, providing multiple written warnings of imminent terror attacks, and working hard to stop this threat, no action was taken. In fact, our sources say to me that the police were ordered to stand down and stop the Sufis, when Sufi (spiritual Islam) adherents fought with Zahran themselves. This is because Zahran clearly says he’s part of Jihad and kept saying he’d carry out Jihad. The Sri Lanka Police are part of the Ministry of Defence, they report to Sirisena. This written evidence has also been seen by the entire defence ministry, the courts, and certain individuals. This is the only reason why Sirisena’s been found guilty of negligence by Sri Lanka Courts. However, this evidence of written warnings hasn’t been released to the public to observe.</p>
            <p class="solution">I was aggrieved to see on BBC News that many Moslems were attacked, shops were damaged and so many were reduced to Zahran's status unfairly as a repercussion of this injustice. We want to center our political campaign around positive traits of our vision, developing our nation to first world status and solving our worst problems as a society. We don't want to stoop to deriding villagers as terrorist collaborators for concocting conspiracies to murder our own people to divide us as enemies. Let's just try to keep this civilized.</p>
            
            <h2>Justice for 4/21 Victims</h2>
            <p>I promise to publish these warnings for the public, ask Modi and Jaishankar to inform our public of the steps they took to warn Sirisena personally, and then bring Sirisena to justice for 4/21. I’m ashamed most of all, that my country Sri Lanka let down such wealthy foreigners visiting Sri Lanka in this way. The Kingdom of Denmark’s richest man Ander Povlsen’s lost 3 out of his 7 children. After many years, Sirisena was only asked to pay a fine of $250,000 dollars to the 270 victim’s families. Sirisena’s humiliated the victims further by saying that he’s got no money. Despite getting a criminal bribe of $295 million as “a gift” from China in exchange for likely approving shady deals.</p>

            <p class="solution">Yes, we will deliver justice. It's heart-breaking to see the salt being rubbed into the painful wounds inflicted on our people who tried to enjoy Easter Sunday as a day on which Jesus rose from the dead.</p>
        
            <h2>Sirisena Backed by Deepa</h2>
            <p>Sirisena’s attracted people like Deepa Edirisinghe to support his politics. Deepa was an ETI Finance director, who has defrauded close to $100 million dollars with what appears to be a Ponzi scheme from close to 20,000 to 35,000 depositors. We will bring them to justice.</p>
            <p class="solution">Trust us on this: we know all about these types of thieves, their lies, and will make sure they will not be able to escape with what they stole.</p>
        </section>
        

        <section id="china-intro">
            <h1>China</h1>
            <h2>Economic Drain</h2>
            <p>China earns over $6 billion dollars from Sri Lanka. This money is wiped off our GDP, we become more indebted and struggle to survive. They’re planning out and threatening to invade Taiwan. China is also sponsoring North Korea.</p>
            
            <p class="solution">China should have invested in pig farms! Rather than this, they paid for Rajapaksa's campaigns where he played this hardcore Sinhalese buddhist strongman. Only to betray us as a nation by signing loss making deals. We want to do business with the second most important economic powerhouse. We have many Chinese friends. It's worth doing it right. China is a friend to us, who have invested in areas, when nobody else would. Even if they were not feasible, and should not have done so. We will be ready to honor sensible deals, offer up good opportunity for investing and respond to any requests with courage. While we might be pro-US, we are still respecting China's contributions to our nation.</p>

            <h2>Chinese Election Interference</h2>
            <p>China paid millions of dollars for the elections campaigns of Mahinda Rajapaksa, Maithripala Sirisena, and Gotabaya. China paid for the elections, then paid many millions of dollars in bribes in exchange for signing loss-making deals. These were not feasible deals that they paid bribes to sign.</p>
            <p class="solution">They have to be held responsible for this, as the relationships of complicity here revealing. They need to cooperate with us on criminal investigations, especially to verify documents, substantiate evidence and share perspectives on these dealings. While we respect Xi Jinping for treasuring the trust his friends place in him, especially in secret. We are keen on becoming a high-trust society who have free, open and frank dialogues, especially in top level, state to state business dealings. We can't proceed any further if there is criminal conduct ("illegal lobbying"), have to disqualify or suspend such projects and hold the Chinese government responsible for violating the sanctity of international trade. This may have spillover consequences for the Belt and Road Initiative, at a time when China owes a lot of debt internally, which can result in a loss of face. </p>
        
            <h2>Dishonest Traps</h2>
            <p>No other creditors or countries wished to bet on these loans as they’re simply not feasible. To mitigate the risk, they charged high interest rates, stipulated we pay only Chinese companies with these loans, buy Chinese materials, and also repay the funds in a short term. These were not feasible deals that they paid bribes to sign. They knew this harbor in Hambantota would fail, so they paid bribes to sign it, so we would incur losses, and hand it over to China.</p>
            <p class="solution">This is not cool. The people of Sri Lanka are being asked to make a serious decision as a nation on whether they wish to continue down this pathway to losses. We are still happy to do business with China, but only if it's profitable, sustainable and conducted in good conscience.</p>


            <h2>Chinese Belt and Road</h2>
            <p>The entire Belt and Road initiative has been built on paying bribes to corrupt decision-makers. All the Belt and Road member countries have extremely bad reputations. All of China’s partner countries score very poorly in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.</p>
            <p class="solution">This is quite sad. We don't want to lose China as a friend, but if they don't get it together, we will be happy to cut our losses, and leave them in the past.</p>
            
            <p>Almost all of these countries, caught in this “debt-trap,” are now having serious problems. They are often giving up assets they built with these loans but remain in more debt. This is easy to understand. The reason it’s done is because China bribed very corrupt traitors into deliberately betraying the country.</p>
            <p>So for instance, if they borrow $5 billion to build a port at $4 billion, as they think it will earn $1 billion per year, then they must repay the $5 billion. But if the port doesn’t earn, then they will give this to China as collateral to earn $1 billion instead. But they must still somehow pay $5 billion back to China without the $4 billion port that earns $1 billion per year. Which is absurd.</p>
            <p>Again: the only reason it’s been signed is because of criminal bribes.</p>
            
            <h2>Pariah Country Schemes</h2>
            <p>These pariah status nations often take efforts to provide school curriculums, weapons, or tech. Even in the US, Russia is famous for planting deep undercover moles to try to steal secrets. China uses weather balloons to steal signals intelligence in the US.</p>
            <p>The enemy conditions or grooms Sri Lanka to do business with China, Russia, or Iran and reject the US or UK. This is by playing on xenophobic themes such as whites are bad, or that the colonial era was bad.</p>
            <p class="solution">We don't want to continue these wicked plots to dupe our people into making the worst of their lives. We want to get along with people, living in the here and now. We see China's rise as a strength, and any failure, be it Xi's fall from grace, Belt and Road's collapse or Chinese people suffering as "bad news" for all of us too. China has contributed a stabilizing presence in Asia, which we admire.</p>
            
            <h2>Chinese Spying</h2>
            <p>I think that the telecommunications equipment supplied to Sri Lanka by China for very low cost is to try to spy on civilians. Huawei and ZTE were banned in the US and the UK. Even TikTok isn’t allowed to be used now by US government employees.</p>
            <p>I think that the Sri Lanka military communications platform is provided by China for free. This is in fact treason, as it’s espionage and allowed exfiltration of state secrets to a foreign power, not known by the general public and not acceptable in any other country. It’s all the more disgusting because of how our people’s fundamental rights to privacy are violated by foreign pariah states.</p>
            
            <p class="solution">We have a responsibility to people who trust us, to deliver safe comms to them. We don't want any more funny business in our backyard. This is our Sri Lanka's backyard, not China's or America's. As our ally, the US has spied on their own citizens unlawfully, we accept that we have lost the moral argument. But we won't lose the legal war on this. We are using sensible equipment, protocols and methods. </p>
            
        
            <h2>Supporting Mistakes</h2>
            <p>When these Sri Lankan side politicians make such statements, they appear to represent “The Republic of Sri Lanka” when they say so. So, if the president of Sri Lanka, they represent the people of the country when condemning the US. This is all part of an unsustainable strategy by China.</p>
            <p class="solution">Our people can see through this, media literacy has been hard earned by us and they are not as tolerant now.</p>
