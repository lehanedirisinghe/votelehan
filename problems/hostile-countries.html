            <h1>Hostile Countries</h1>
        
            <h2>Pariah States</h2>
            <p>Russia, Iran, and China.</p>
        
            <h2>Foreign Threats We Face</h2>
            <p>Sri Lankans are unlucky that pariah states have long-term plans to harm us. These pariah nations have committed war crimes, fraud, and terrorism.</p>
            
            <h2>Bad Influence</h2>
            <p>When you are often the average of your top 5 friends you hang out with, it’s obviously very unhealthy for us to be buddies with these three pariah states. We also learn many bad habits from them. They enable us to commit atrocities as a bad influence.</p>
            <p>Due to social failures, Sri Lanka was at one point friendly with Iraq, who were our biggest buyer of tea. The evil culture permeating has led to us befriending the wrong people.</p>
        
            <h2>Impunity Culture</h2>
            <p>I believe we even adopted our culture of impunity from these pariah states. We are also often held guilty by association by the international community. I’ve seen China try to coax or goad Sri Lanka onto China’s side by pretending to side with us on war crimes issues. This kind of tactic does work, so they do it regularly.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="russia-intro">
  
            <h1>Russia</h1>
        
            <h2>Losses to Russia</h2>
            <p>We lose approximately $2 billion to Russia every year.</p>
        
            <h2>Bullying Ukraine</h2>
            <p>Russia invaded Ukraine illegally, after lying they wouldn’t. They see us as a military base to make use of. They’re desperate to get rid of the US.</p>
            
            <h2>Russian Patrons</h2>
            <p>Russia uses expensive patrons who are decision-makers to sign corrupt deals. These are criminal deals for MiG fighter aircrafts, weapon deals, coal imports, and even prostitution rackets. We saw Eastern European girls trafficked to Sri Lanka to forcibly work as indentured sex workers.</p>
        
            <h2>Murdering Journalists</h2>
            <p>Many journalists have sadly been murdered for reporting on these serious crimes. Often journalists are shamefully killed for stating facts, professional opinions (totally objective), or for simply copying government Gazette notifications published by the state officials themselves regarding such deals.</p>
            
            <h2>Corrupting Defence Ministry</h2>
            <p>In any country, the most corrupt area is often defense. This is because you can claim it’s for “national security” to hide or cover up a “military secret”. This means that any purchases are hidden. I think that construction or engineering is the second most corrupt area because costing estimates are subjective. This is followed by technology, banking, and cyber, as they relate to final pricing.</p>
            
            <h2>Danger with Russia</h2>
            <p>Russia is dangerous as they advise their patrons to spread disgust for the US, they often advise assassinations of journalists and rush to justify such crimes. China has provided snide options on Weibo, such as “The US interferes, causes problems everywhere”. Russia also promotes such rhetoric. This is often used to disqualify the US in many business dealings or public tenders unfairly.</p>
            
            <h2>Russian Deals</h2>
            <p>The coal is often marked up by 100% before being sold to Sri Lanka. This is likely the highest price any country pays for coal imports. There’s absolutely no transparency on these dealings or purchases even though these are all taxpayer-funded.</p>

        <section id="iran-intro">
            <h1>Iran</h1>
        
            <h2>Hidden Oil Purchases</h2>
            <p>We lose over $1 billion dollars to Iran every year to purchase oil. This large sum of money is often hidden by Sri Lanka’s government citing “national interest”. You won’t find it in the public finances. However, it’s well known that Iran is the only supplier of oil. We don’t buy from Saudis or UAE. To escape or avoid international sanctions placed on Iran, Iran will often use Singapore to sell oil products. As oil is a mostly homogenous product, it’s easy for them to do so, especially with processing. Iran is very dangerous as they regularly support Islamic terrorism internationally.</p>
            
            <h2>Nuclear Threats by Iran</h2>
            <p>Iran’s parliament unanimously promises to use nuclear weapons on Israel. This was after Trump ordered a drone strike to kill Qasem Soleimani. Iran often spreads anti-semitism in Sri Lanka as they arm Hamas to murder Israeli civilians.</p>
            
            <h2>Iran Spreads Anti-Semitism</h2>
            <p>Our country has close to 2 million Muslims. Most of our Muslims follow Sunni Islam. There is an extremist form of Sunni known as Wahhabi. In Saudi Arabia, the Wahabis keep the House of Saud in power. The House of Saud is a largely secular group headed by Prince Salman who are reform or moderate Muslims. They keep the extremists around. The Iranians follow Shia Islam. The contempt towards Israel over Palestine found in Sri Lanka usually stems from Iran. This takes the form of widespread anti-semitism which isn’t found elsewhere.</p>
            
            <h2>Public Finances Stolen for Terrorism</h2>
            <p>Iran has been Sri Lanka’s supplier of crude oil for a long time. But this isn’t reported in public finances anywhere. This money is suspiciously hidden. It’s billions of dollars. It goes to local agents who represent Iran. This money is likely kept hidden in Sri Lanka by extremists loyal to Iran in a “black budget” to be used by terrorists. It’s very likely this is how the Easter Sunday Terror Attacks in 2019 on April 21st were paid for and carried out. It was understood they had high-tech equipment, explosives, and methods of carrying this out. Zahran Hashim’s been involved in imported spices such as Iran’s saffron. It’s easy to launder this to avoid terrorist investigations and financial intelligence on money trails. It’s likely that the black budget, like a CIA black budget, is used to stage protests against Israel in front of the UN from time to time. Or even to protest against the UK or the US as the Iran government hates the US equally.</p>
            
            <h2>2019 April 21 Deliberate Failures</h2>
            <p>In my opinion, the Israeli Mossad (foreign intelligence service) and Israeli Embassy in Sri Lanka operate out of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka. They have observed, then reported on this imminent terrorist attack to India’s Research and Analysis Wing. As they are watching Iran’s activity closely. RAW had provided multiple written warnings using multiple official channels to Maithripala Sirisena, the then president and minister of defence. Despite following protocols and procedures in making requests, providing multiple written warnings of imminent terror attacks, and working hard to stop this threat, no action was taken. In fact, our sources say to me that the police were ordered to stand down and stop the Sufis, when Sufi (spiritual Islam) adherents fought with Zahran themselves. This is because Zahran clearly says he’s part of Jihad and kept saying he’d carry out Jihad. The Sri Lanka Police are part of the Ministry of Defence, they report to Sirisena. This written evidence has also been seen by the entire defence ministry, the courts, and certain individuals. This is the only reason why Sirisena’s been found guilty of negligence by Sri Lanka Courts. However, this evidence of written warnings hasn’t been released to the public to observe.</p>
            
            <h2>Justice for 4/21 Victims</h2>
            <p>I promise to publish these warnings for the public, ask Modi and Jaishankar to inform our public of the steps they took to warn Sirisena personally, and then bring Sirisena to justice for 4/21. I’m ashamed most of all, that my country Sri Lanka let down such wealthy foreigners visiting Sri Lanka in this way. The Kingdom of Denmark’s richest man Ander Povlsen’s lost 3 out of his 7 children. After many years, Sirisena was only asked to pay a fine of $250,000 dollars to the 270 victim’s families. Sirisena’s humiliated the victims further by saying that he’s got no money. Despite getting a criminal bribe of $295 million as “a gift” from China in exchange for likely approving shady deals.</p>
        
            <h2>Sirisena Backed by Deepa</h2>
            <p>Sirisena’s attracted people like Deepa Edirisinghe to support his politics. Deepa was an ETI Finance director, who has defrauded close to $100 million dollars with what appears to be a Ponzi scheme from close to 20,000 to 35,000 depositors. We will bring them to justice.</p>

        <section id="china-intro">
            <h1>China</h1>
            <h2>Economic Drain</h2>
            <p>China earns over $6 billion dollars from Sri Lanka. This money is wiped off our GDP, we become more indebted and struggle to survive. They’re planning out and threatening to invade Taiwan. China is also sponsoring North Korea.</p>
            
            <h2>Chinese Election Interference</h2>
            <p>China paid millions of dollars for the elections campaigns of Mahinda Rajapaksa, Maithripala Sirisena, and Gotabaya. China paid for the elections, then paid many millions of dollars in bribes in exchange for signing loss-making deals. These were not feasible deals that they paid bribes to sign.</p>
        
            <h2>Dishonest Traps</h2>
            <p>No other creditors or countries wished to bet on these loans as they’re simply not feasible. To mitigate the risk, they charged high interest rates, stipulated we pay only Chinese companies with these loans, buy Chinese materials, and also repay the funds in a short term. These were not feasible deals that they paid bribes to sign. They knew this harbor in Hambantota would fail, so they paid bribes to sign it, so we would incur losses, and hand it over to China.</p>
            <p>No other creditors or countries wished to bet on these loans as they were simply not feasible. To mitigate the risk, they charged high interest rates, stipulated we pay only Chinese companies with these loans, buy Chinese materials, and also repay the funds in a short term. These were impractical.</p>
        
            <h2>Chinese Belt and Road</h2>
            <p>The entire Belt and Road initiative has been built on paying bribes to corrupt decision-makers. All the Belt and Road member countries have extremely bad reputations. All of China’s partner countries score very poorly in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.</p>
            <p>Almost all of these countries, caught in this “debt-trap,” are now having serious problems. They are often giving up assets they built with these loans but remain in more debt. This is easy to understand. The reason it’s done is because China bribed very corrupt traitors into deliberately betraying the country.</p>
            <p>So for instance, if they borrow $5 billion to build a port at $4 billion, as they think it will earn $1 billion per year, then they must repay the $5 billion. But if the port doesn’t earn, then they will give this to China as collateral to earn $1 billion instead. But they must still somehow pay $5 billion back to China without the $4 billion port that earns $1 billion per year. Which is absurd.</p>
            <p>Again: the only reason it’s been signed is because of criminal bribes.</p>
            
            <h2>Pariah Country Schemes</h2>
            <p>These pariah status nations often take efforts to provide school curriculums, weapons, or tech. Even in the US, Russia is famous for planting deep undercover moles to try to steal secrets. China uses weather balloons to steal signals intelligence in the US.</p>
            <p>The enemy conditions or grooms Sri Lanka to do business with China, Russia, or Iran and reject the US or UK. This is by playing on xenophobic themes such as whites are bad, or that the colonial era was bad.</p>
        
            <h2>Chinese Spying</h2>
            <p>I think that the telecommunications equipment supplied to Sri Lanka by China for very low cost is to try to spy on civilians. Huawei and ZTE were banned in the US and the UK. Even TikTok isn’t allowed to be used now by US government employees.</p>
            <p>I think that the Sri Lanka military communications platform is provided by China for free. This is in fact treason, as it’s espionage and allowed exfiltration of state secrets to a foreign power, not known by the general public and not acceptable in any other country. It’s all the more disgusting because of how our people’s fundamental rights to privacy are violated by foreign pariah states.</p>
        
            <h2>Supporting Mistakes</h2>
            <p>When these Sri Lankan side politicians make such statements, they appear to represent “The Republic of Sri Lanka” when they say so. So, if the president of Sri Lanka, they represent the people of the country when condemning the US. This is all part of an unsustainable strategy by China.</p>
