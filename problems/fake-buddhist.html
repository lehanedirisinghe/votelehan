            <h1>Fake Buddhist</h1>
        
            <h2>A Weaponized Faith</h2>
            <p>Our majority religion Theravada Buddhism has been terribly managed by criminals.</p>
            <p>It’s easy for anyone to be a Buddhist monk in Sri Lanka. There’s not much regulation or supervision or oversight.</p>
            <p>This religion has been corrupted to a sinister religion to suit the needs of the “This Is Sri Lanka” Cult.</p>
        
            <h2>Damaged Message</h2>
            <p>Buddhism’s entire message has been disfigured. A message to reduce suffering, now only causes it.</p>
            <p>It seems, out of the four noble truths, only the first two are understood. However, the last two parts, which are more important to the message, are completely forgotten.</p>
            <p>The precepts to avoid murders, theft, rapes, frauds and intoxicants, only justify it “in moderation”. The spirit of Buddhism has been betrayed.</p>
            <p>Monks say Lee Kuan Yew's a real Buddhist: untrue as he's secular. They claim people in Europe or America are the real Buddhists: untrue as they are secular or Christian.</p>
            <p>What they mean is they are happy, as they're not stuck in poverty because of Buddhist-lobbied policies. Those societies are functional as people have real food to eat, without closet-hindu vegan beliefs.</p>
            <p>Most of the Buddhists we all seem to know, who are truly happy, are living in mostly white, Christian countries.</p>
            <p>We want to develop Sri Lanka, with a modern, mature and constructive form of Theravada, as interpreted by us, not fanatical monks.</p>
            <p>We want to decide what moral direction we're headed as a people; not by hardcore, extremist monks.</p>
        
            <h2>Fake Buddhist Rituals</h2>
            <p>These perversions have resulted in extremely serious damages to society where we can’t recover. This fake Buddhist cult's version spread to all areas. You see it practiced by most politicians.</p>
            <p>These people wear a pirith string, throw water in a bo fig tree, chant some foreigner prayers, to show they are Buddhists. I see that a number of temples in Sri Lanka are guilty of causing this degeneration.</p>
            <p>The reason this problem is so rapacious is because it’s been misused to defend crimes. I’ve seen senior Buddhist prelates even forgive and support serious criminals because they’re fellow Buddhists.</p>
            <p>This confuses the majority of Buddhists to also forgive and tolerate and accept those criminals as leaders. This is one of the worst sins as it’s evil to do so.</p>
        
            <h2>Buddhist Structure Degraded</h2>
            <p>Buddhism has enjoyed a comparatively pristine reputation. Unlike Christianity, Judaism or Islam, or Hinduism: Buddhists avoid harming anyone. We don’t sponsor any kinds of wars or military campaigns or socially harmful businesses or individual actions. We never proselytize or convert anyone.</p>
            <p>However, recently, this has changed. We’ve become more like the Roman Catholic Church when they used to sell Indulgences for money to pay for sins. The theme of abstaining from harming others or stealing as it’s wrong has been misinterpreted. Now it means that it’s only bad to do so all of the time, but that it’s okay to kill or steal every now and then. This is crazy.</p>
        
            <h2>Mistakes Justified</h2>
            <p>Often people use this claim to release murderers, as they argue Buddha pardoned Angulimala. This has been used to release a number of murderers in Sri Lanka. It’s very dangerous as it’s made us seem like we have no justice here at all.</p>
            <p>When you disagree with this decision by locals, they will tell you angrily, that you are not a Buddhist because you don’t accept a murderer must be released. They will obviously then claim that because Buddha didn’t kill Angulimala, a murderer, it’s okay to always let murderers escape justice.</p>
            <p>It's different to not execute or carry out death penalties, because we're a supposed Theravada country in name.</p>
        
            <h2>Not Killing Animals</h2>
            <p>Refusal to kill mosquitoes likewise, citing Buddha’s first precept, results in dengue or tourists feeling uncomfortable. They forget that human life is more valuable. But if you disagree, or kill a mosquito: they will say you’re not a Buddhist.</p>
        
            <h2>Buddhist Monks Set Public Policy</h2>
            <p>The monks are the biggest lobbying group in Sri Lanka. They also have a large following, who lobby politicians on their behalf.</p>
            <p>This kind of mixing Temple and State, with this false interpretation of our religion, is ruinous. The problem is also to do with defeatism or accepting to give up, or not working hard to achieve results.</p>
            <p>These have damaged our nation’s economy and ability to produce competitive goods and services.</p>
            <p>Buddha advised to avoid animal slaughter (farming), poisons (chemicals), weapons, slavery (debt, gambling) or intoxicants (drugs, alcohol) as they harm. However, the modern equivalents are essential products, and are highly profitable (for 1,000s of years) and required by all.</p>
            <p>It’s wise to do these mindfully that they are harmful, unlike for-profit firms who ignore the social costs. This caused Sri Lanka to be a poor, miserable country, where we cannot produce the products we need.</p>
        
            <h2>Leading Buddhists</h2>
            <p>The entire Buddhist religion needs a figurehead to lead the Theravada Buddhist religion. I’m seeking to be the new supreme governor of Theravada Buddhism to lead this majority faith properly.</p>
            <p>I am secular. I'm not a Hindu or Jain. My grandma Milina ran the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress. Even if my uncle Jagath has also served as president of ACBC. I will be able to administer it in a more constructive way. This is so, that our people are able to be successful.</p>
            <p>We will no longer tolerate having people adopt a beggar mindset, identity or psyche, which monks have wrongly taught people in Sri Lanka to inculcate.</p>
            <p>As the new president, I will also be the head of the armed forces, the police and the courts as well. So, it would be my honor to also be in charge of the administration of the Buddhist religion in Sri Lanka. I can appoint some veteran administrators of Buddhism to run this as my 1st minister for Buddhism.</p>
            <p>While I don’t know if only a Buddhist may be the executive president of Sri Lanka. I know the head of state must personally direct the religion of the country.</p>
        
            <h2>Problem Monks</h2>
            <p>The problem with the Buddhist monks is they often individually think they’re the Buddha and enlightened. This omniscience, this is unbecoming of monks, and has derailed the institution as a whole because it’s not true.</p>
            <p>Many of these people are often uneducated, don’t follow the Digha Nikaya at all and appear to be crooks. I saw some monks harmed civilians, breach rules of conduct and are even businesspeople or criminal thugs.</p>
            <p>I don't think sex is bad. However, Siddhartha felt so, as he was from a Hindu background, inspired by Jain monks he saw. He taught having sex was going to make it harder to get enlightened. He kicked a monk out of his group because he had a child with his wife to pass his wealth onto.</p>
            <p>I think he is a hypocrite because he had a child Rahula with Yasodora; who got his wealth or assets, despite him treating his followers with a double-standard.</p>
            <p>I don't think it's correct for young children or boys to be ordained as Buddhist monks, as they may not fully understand their decisions. I think they should wait until they are 18 years old, or able to consent as fully informed adults, with some maturity, exposure and education.</p>
            <p>I personally sense that many of those monks are sexually frustrated, and despite claiming to be voluntarily celibate, are in fact, involuntarily celibate (without sex), and very reluctantly so.</p>
            <p>Monks for example, look at porn on their phones and clearly want sex, although they are being denied it by their monk peers and by Buddhist society who deny them basic human needs or rights. I feel they are quite angry about it, don't think it's correct and feel sorry for them.</p>
            <p>I’m a very secular humanist. I avoid nominal denominations, but value most religions in a healthy way. You can rest assured, we will lead this religious institution successfully.</p>
            <p>I will ask Bhikku Bodi to act as the chief monk. I’ve assessed all of the thought leaders on Buddhism, and I’ve picked him.</p>
            <p>He’s written the book Anthology on Buddhist Discourses. He can do a good service as the first in command. I think Walpola Rahula, who wrote What The Buddha Taught, is also a good pick for second in command.</p>
            <p>I believe it’s wise when the president’s not religious at all. It makes most people feel comfortable, especially globally. I think while I refuse to identify as a Buddhist or a Christian, the ones who do claim to be Buddhists are hypocrites.</p>
        
            <h2>Elite Theravada</h2>
            <p>I also will re-position Theravada as elite, professional Buddhism, whereas Mahayana will instead be more fit for most people.</p>
            <p>Mahayana is mostly in Japan, China, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea–all successful Buddhist nations. These are happy places. Mahayana is the biggest form of Buddhism today. Our Theravada is used here in (totally corrupt) Sri Lanka, (corrupt) Thailand, (genocidal) Myanmar (a.k.a. Burma), Laos and Cambodia.</p>
            <p>Pol Pot was a Buddhist monk. He’s from Cambodia. And yet, he went on to kill many people for politics. The Rohingya get killed by Buddhists in Myanmar. These nations with Theravada in comparison often have extremely severe social problems. These social problems overflow into severe political problems.</p>
        
            <h2>Buddha's Fears</h2>
            <p>The reason is to do with why Buddha originally refused to teach upon achieving enlightenment: it’s too intense, so people won’t fully understand it.</p>
            <p>Buddha later changed his mind. However, the reason he demanded to keep teaching until he died at 80 was because he always knew this message was very difficult for the vast majority of people even then to understand.</p>
            <p>This fact is especially true when the average IQ is extremely low at 85, so the followers sadly wouldn’t understand this message as intended. In comparison, the Bible or Quran are very easy to read, very small, short and concise books.</p>
            <p>I saw that the bigger problem with Buddhism, is when the monks who choose to be monks, they don't differentiate between ordinary people and monks, and apply their extremist monk standards upon ordinary people.</p>
            <p>This all led to a social collapse, as people were reduced to beggars, and a nation of beggars as a burden on the rest of the world. There is no respect, admiration or value to being beggars or poverty.</p>
        
            <h2>Buddhist Principles Betrayed</h2>
            <p>The entire Buddhist religion has shamefully turned into a credit card debt problem with karma instead of progress. They imagine that if they make a mistake, they will pay for it later like many people take on credit card debts endlessly.</p>
            <p>They keep doing this, which is mentally unhygienic. This results in serious problems for everyone. As accountability won’t start, if they keep refreshing or resetting their moral standing/position.</p>
            <p>99% of Buddhists haven’t read the Tripitaka, and they blindly follow due to group thinking or social conformity only. If you ask them why they’re Buddhists: the only real answer is that their parents are Buddhists.</p>
            <p>When we re-position Theravada as elite Buddhism, it’s going to help us to restore our standing globally.</p>
            <p>We want to regain a hygienic, clean and sustainable religious institution that’s respected, seen as safe and cool.</p>
