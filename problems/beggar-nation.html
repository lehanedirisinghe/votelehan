            <h1>Beggar Nation</h1>
        
            <h2>Dependence on Loans</h2>
            <p>Sri Lanka is begging for loans to pay for basic necessities like food. This dependency is a result of poor economic planning and failed leadership. Instead of investing in machinery or businesses that produce goods for export, we are trapped in a cycle of borrowing and spending.</p>

            <p>This leaves us vulnerable and unable to build a strong, self-sufficient economy. We must shift our focus to investments that generate long-term benefits and resilience. By doing so, we can break free from this cycle of dependency and move towards a prosperous future.</p>
        
            <h2>Starving Kids</h2>
            <p>Due to serious mismanagement, many of Sri Lanka's children are starving. They receive less than 1,000 calories per day when they need over 2,000 to grow fully. The food quality is also poor, often contaminated with chemicals or ultra-processed.</p>
            
            <p>This is not just a failure of our leaders but a direct consequence of our choices at the polls. When we elect leaders who lack vision, our children suffer. They are being unfairly starved, and their futures are compromised because we fail to demand better governance.</p>
        
            <h2>A Call to Action for Parents</h2>
            <p>As mothers and fathers, we must ensure our children have the opportunity to thrive. We need to recognize the urgent need for change in our leadership and economic policies. Our children's futures are at stake, and it is our duty to demand better for them.</p>
            
            <p>We must support leaders who prioritize investments in education, healthcare, and sustainable development. By doing so, we can create a nation where our children have access to nutritious food, quality education, and the opportunities they need to succeed.</p>
        
            <h2>Empowering Voters</h2>
            <p>As voters, we have the power to shape the future of our nation. We must be informed and critical of our choices at the polls. It is essential to elect leaders who have a clear vision for sustainable development and are committed to strategic investments in our economy.</p>

            <p>We need leaders who will break the cycle of dependency by building a robust industrial base, improving agricultural productivity, and fostering innovation. These steps are necessary to transform Sri Lanka into a developed country.</p>
            
            <p>By making informed choices and holding our leaders accountable, we can ensure a brighter future for our children and generations to come. Let's come together to demand the change we need to build a prosperous, self-sufficient nation.</p>
