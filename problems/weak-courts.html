            <h1>Weak Courts in Sri Lanka</h1>
        
            <p>Many people in Sri Lanka complain “corruption” is our biggest problem. This is a legal problem. It means most believe there are no courts. It’s very well understood that criminals in Sri Lanka never face any real justice at all. They get away.</p>
            
            <h2>Crime and Punishment Disparities</h2>
            <p>Although, young people are bullied by the cops. As LGBT persons are arrested and abused very wickedly by our police. As rape victims are humiliated. Although poor people are thrown in jail for very small mistakes. Criminals who murder many or steal millions are often not going to face any kind of issues.</p>
            
            <h2>Legislative Failures and Court Ineffectiveness</h2>
            <p>The biggest reason the courts don’t work is that the parliamentarians have very low intelligence. So they often pass poorly written legislation that isn’t very sophisticated, constructive or healthy. This is what courts use. This is the foundational problem. As the laws are bad, those bad laws are what judges must use or interpret.</p>
            
            <h2>Politically Influenced Judicial Appointments</h2>
            <p>The judges, especially the chief justice, who leads the courts, is often picked by the president personally. Often these persons will always listen to and support the president, often a criminal, to do his or her work. You can see chief justices like Shirani Bandaranayake, were impeached by parliament for refusing orders.</p>
            
            <h2>Extensive Delays in Legal Proceedings</h2>
            <p>The courts often are notorious for taking extremely long amounts of time to process cases. It’s frightening. I’ve heard property cases span generations. If you have to go to court for years to settle a small dispute, it’s not sensible. If you have to take 1 year to handle a divorce case, it’s not sensible.</p>
            <p>Even business fraud cases, with simple issues, rules/ laws, applications and conclusions: take many years. This is very bad.</p>
            <p>It means that people lose faith in the judicial system and then this leads to people using crime to survive. When you go to court, to solve a murder case or a theft. Then courts don’t take action. You still have to survive.</p>
            
            <h2>Poor Quality of Judicial Rulings</h2>
            <p>When courts also pass bad rulings, often which aren’t very sustainable, they act as legally binding precedents. This is the central cornerstone to the “This Is Sri Lanka” Cult who depend purely on frustrating you. It’s always about trying to prove to you that “This Is Sri Lanka” where there’s no justice system to rely on.</p>
            <p>When a court says that if someone can pick up an item displayed, by keeping cash at the window, without speaking to the merchant: this means that there’s no contract law. But if judged it is okay to do so. This means it’s okay for anyone to do so in Sri Lanka as it’s suddenly the new law.</p>
            
            <h2>Consequences of a Corrupt Judicial System</h2>
            <p>They want to establish firmly that if you steal, they won’t go to courts, but kill you, so your family go to courts. Murders are now a status symbol. People respect those who can get away as they “have power” to do so. There is low legal intelligence in general. People don’t know how the courts work or why they’re needed.</p>
            <p>When the bad rulings establish, that this is the way of doing things, that corrupt culture is established. This makes international businesses feel scared. If they do visit, they’ll play by Sri Lanka rules: pay bribes or get a crooked local partner.</p>
            
            <h2>Systemic Issues in the Sri Lankan Judiciary</h2>
            <p>The whole courts are also conducted in Sinhalese. When there is no use of English. You can’t digitize. As you usually need English, to write in computers.</p>
            <p>This means 1. Court Chief Justices are appointed by politicians, 2. Laws are passed by parliamentarians who lack good judgement, 3. Laws are enforced by people hired by politicians, 4. There’s no open tracking of any active, pending cases, and in the end: 5. Everyone’s miserable.</p>
            <p>People like Gotabaya also provide presidential pardons to release persons convicted of murders which symbolize the culture of impunity.</p>
