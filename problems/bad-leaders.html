            <h1>Bad Leaders</h1>
        
            <h2>Common Traits</h2>
            <p>Many of our politicians are uneducated, dishonest criminals with criminal convictions. I have heard stories they haven’t passed their O Level exams.</p>
        
            <h2>Not Our Best</h2>
            <p>I think they’re not the best or brightest we have to offer. They appear to be the least intelligent, least honest and least capable. These individuals have no education, no qualifications and only follow orders from criminals. In US or UK, the people often select their best people to serve as leaders. For example, you would rather go to a top-ranked hospital in the world, to seek a top-ranking brain surgeon to perform a life-or-death medical operation; not go to an uneducated local doctor with a bad name. This same logic applies to governing a country.</p>
        
            <h2>Violent Acts</h2>
            <p>Local Sri Lankan politicians often hire and order uneducated bodyguards to ambush and murder journalists or innocent civilians. Sometimes, in the past, these thugs were assigned to run police units to help carry out crimes.</p>
            
            <h2>Observed Behavior</h2>
            <p>Most of these criminal politicians can’t speak English properly, can’t give straight answers and hate you. When you speak to them, you can see, they’ve got no vision, can’t manage or have any accountability.</p>
        
            <h2>Bad Management Tactics</h2>
            <p>They also don’t know how to interview, hire and manage people properly, often doing it criminally. I’ve seen footage of them even saying absurd things like if you’re short you can be an office peon, or else, if you’re tall, you can be a security guard. They’ve promised and justified to hire their political supporters to work for them in government ministries if they are elected.</p>
        
            <h2>Bad Names</h2>
            <p>The local newspapers are full of reports of these criminals stealing, murdering or injuring civilians. Although, most of the important identifying details are omitted or hidden out of fear of being murdered.</p>
            
            <h2>Bad Name For Us</h2>
            <p>Sadly: Yes. They’ve got the international spotlight on BBC or NY Times for atrocities like murders or corruption.</p>
            <p>Our whole country is perceived poorly because our leaders represent all of us so poorly. This forces people all over the world to lose respect for us, to fear us and treat us poorly. In fact, there’s suspicions given the falsified public finances, they’ve stolen entire percentages of budgets.</p>
        
            <h2>Evidence Of Theft</h2>
            <p>They possess valuable assets, property or belongings they can’t explain how they came to own. They are supposed to be paid maybe $50,000 per year, but own millions of dollars in assets.</p>
            
            <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30953923"><p>Sri Lanka seizes car fleet 'not returned by Rajapaksa'</p></a>
            
            <p>They own multiple properties which are extremely large, many luxury sports cars and many very expensive luxury watches. I don’t think even the President of France has such expensive French watches. Macron owns a $5,000 watch. These guys here own watches worth more.</p>
            <p>They then lie they don’t have any money to the public. It’s also known they’ve killed people for very wrong reasons, but faced no penalties.</p>
            
            <h2>International Media Response</h2>
            <p>The international media, such as ABC News Australia caught them for money laundering on tape. I saw they quickly threatened to sue the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and even promised to drop the lawsuit for defamation if ABC News Australia drops the news story and apologises. However, our local media, after many murders of journalists, aren’t able to mention them now.</p>
            
            <h2>Irresponsible Voters</h2>
            <p>We have a crippling problem with irresponsible voters. They do not study or criticize plans when presented.</p>
            <p>They often ask for the wrong things, such as the chemical fertilizer ban. They have in fact, for decades asked for a lot of very bad things, taking their own lives for a joke.</p>
            <p>This is down to a beggar psyche: why our people choose to self-sabotage. We want to make sure this is corrected.</p>
            <p>When the people are honest, or responsible or serious, the people they elect will also be like them.</p>
            <p>It's wrong to blame politicians when an entire country asks for the wrong things because of collective-shortcomings.</p>
