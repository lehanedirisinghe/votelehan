            <h1>Evil Racketeers</h1>
        
            <h2>Sri Lanka's Bankruptcy Cause</h2>
            <p>Close to 20 criminal businessmen control Sri Lanka. These operators of the "This Is Sri Lanka" cult steal most of our wealth every year. All are very patriarchal, sexist men with serious criminal pasts. They are not bright, honest, or sophisticated. They wouldn’t have succeeded in any developed nation with functional courts. In prosperous countries, these criminals would have ended up behind bars. But in undeveloped places like Sri Lanka, they thrive using underhanded, criminal tactics.</p>
        
            <h2>Crushing Honest Locals</h2>
            <p>These criminals often humiliate honest locals, making it impossible for internationally competitive businesses to operate in Sri Lanka. I’ve seen many local businesses that pay taxes get destroyed, while the criminal businesses evade taxes and hide stolen funds overseas. This creates an environment where honesty is punished and criminality is rewarded.</p>
        
            <h2>Paying for Political Puppets</h2>
            <p>They back or fund criminal politicians in exchange for corrupt deals to steal public finances. These politicians, aware of the $12 billion in tax revenues, award these businessmen lucrative deals in return for election support. Such deals are often made long before any political campaign starts. These hardline criminals, who sell heroin to kids, have murder convictions, and have stolen massively from public finances, also own most of Sri Lanka’s media. They present fake news to mislead the public, never showing footage of massive protests like those to depose Gotabaya.</p>
        
            <h2>Deceptive Practices</h2>
            <p>These criminals lie about everything. When asked simple questions about pressing issues, they won’t respond. They control the narrative and mislead the public on critical issues, maintaining their grip on power.</p>
        
            <h2>The Root Cause of the Problem</h2>
            <p>Why do I consider them the biggest problem? Why not the politicians themselves? These businessmen direct the criminal politicians. They write entire political manifestos for presidents or political parties. Policies like Mahinda Chinthana, Dhammika’s Economic Blueprint, Sajith’s version, and Gota’s Vistas of Splendor were likely written by these criminals. The disastrous decisions to ban chemical fertilizers, cut taxes (losing over $1 billion in revenues), and the Port City scam were their handiwork.</p>
        
            <h2>Local Strategy Planning</h2>
            <p>These plans weren’t created to help Sri Lanka but to steal from the $12 billion paid by taxpayers. Groups like Viyath Maga, which appear part of local universities ranking worse than 2,000 internationally, and Bodu Bala Sena, a paramilitary extremist militia, work for corrupt businesses. This industrial complex surrounding uncompetitive businesses extends their lifecycle and maintains corruption.</p>
        
            <h2>Lobbying for Failure</h2>
            <p>These businessmen pay politicians to promote destructive policies. It looks more like third-world bribery than lobbying. Policies like Gota’s “I will build 100,000 km of roads” were written to steal funds through rigged bids and cooked tenders. Roads, often unnecessary, are built on unsustainable, unfeasible loans, with profits shared among corrupt decision-makers. This unfair system enriches a few while burdening everyone else.</p>
        
            <h2>Speaking Out Despite Danger</h2>
            <p>I can’t formally name these criminals without armed security. They’ve already killed many honest people, and they’d likely target me next. We’ve alerted the police and are requesting armed security. Meanwhile, you can easily research, do the math, and find out what happened to your money.</p>
        
            <h2>The Biggest Threat Our People Face</h2>
            <p>The biggest threat to Sri Lanka is these criminal businessmen directing our politicians. While the majority struggle to earn $2,000 per year, these criminals hoard millions. I calculated that one infamous company secretly earned over $1 billion in construction deals. Many firms win tenders through suspicious, likely criminal means. Sri Lanka’s poverty is profitable for these businessmen. Their greed keeps Sri Lanka uncompetitive and impoverished.</p>
        
            <h2>Unpatriotic Greed</h2>
            <p>Sri Lanka’s failure stems from the unpatriotic, sinister greed of local businesses. They betrayed us. The Transatlantic Slave Trade happened because African warlords captured slaves to sell. Similarly, these businessmen capture our economy, selling out our future for their gain. Their greed has made us beggars in our own land.</p>
        
            <h2>A Call for Unity and Action</h2>
            <p>It’s time to stand against these evil racketeers. We must demand transparency and accountability from our leaders and reject the influence of criminal businessmen. Only through unity and determined action can we hope to reclaim our nation and build a future where honesty and hard work are rewarded, not criminality and deceit.</p>
