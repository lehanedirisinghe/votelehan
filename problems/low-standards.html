            <h1>Low Standards in Sri Lanka</h1>
        
            <h2>Low IQ and Its Implications</h2>
            <p>Sri Lanka's average IQ is 78, a troubling statistic that impacts our nation's progress. Our people struggle with math and language skills, particularly English. There's a difficulty with pattern recognition, which is linked to genetic dyscalculia. This low intelligence level hampers our ability to think strategically and solve problems.</p>
        
            <h2>The Impact of a Low IQ Score</h2>
            <p>An average IQ of 78 is "borderline mentally retarded." This affects our cognitive abilities and judgment, leading us to elect known criminals. Our poor choices at the polls have devastating effects on national progress. We lack both intelligence and good judgment.</p>
        
            <h2>Consequences of Poor Choices</h2>
            <p>Historically, voters in Sri Lanka have elected thieves and murderers. Even with evidence of their crimes, voters justify their choices with "This is Sri Lanka." This reflects our acceptance of low standards and our belief that we don't deserve better due to our inability to make wise decisions.</p>
        
            <h2>Causes of Low IQ</h2>
            <p>Our low IQ is due to several factors: lead poisoning in water, inadequate nutrition, insufficient income, lack of good job opportunities, a weak education system, and a culture that doesn't value intelligence or innovation. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive approach.</p>
        
            <h2>Economic Impact of Low Standards</h2>
            <p>Our low IQ affects the quality of our products and services, making us non-competitive. Our goods are often cheap but lack quality. The lack of economic opportunities drives many to emigrate, leading to a brain drain that hinders progress. While tea picking is labor-intensive and low-paying, manufacturing tea machines requires higher intelligence and offers more stability and profit.</p>
        
            <h2>Personal Experiences and Frustrations</h2>
            <p>Even those with education and potential, like myself, find it challenging to thrive here. After returning to Sri Lanka with a degree from the UK and a diploma from Singapore, I realized the business environment is stifling. Many educated young people are desperate to leave, unable to find viable career opportunities. A friend from Cambridge University, who studied Law, cannot practice here due to systemic barriers.</p>
        
            <h2>The Brain Drain Dilemma</h2>
            <p>The constant emigration of our brightest minds is alarming. Sri Lanka has a history of harming, humiliating, and even murdering educated individuals. This hostile environment drives many to flee, seeking safety and better opportunities elsewhere. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot, where educated people were targeted to enforce equality by force.</p>
        
            <h2>A Call for Change</h2>
            <p>We must acknowledge these harsh realities and demand better for our country. It starts with electing leaders who prioritize education, economic development, and strategic investments. Only by addressing the root causes of our low standards can we hope to build a prosperous and competitive Sri Lanka.</p>
