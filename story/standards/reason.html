    <h1>Reason</h1>    

    <h2>Too many serious problems</h2>
    <p>I have a clear reason why Sri Lanka is a country who needs a dictator. This is a country with so many problems, which are so deep, serious and complicated. Without a leader who has total authority, you cannot solve those. </p>
    
    <h2>It has to happen at some point</h2>
    <p>This place will otherwise never develop. </p>
    <p> some point in our history, we need a leader to solve those problems. Whether it's me or any worthy person. They have to be empowered to do so with a public mandate.</p>

    <h2>Only one democracy succeeded</h2>
    <p>The experiment with democracy has always failed. </p>
    <p>Only in Singapore, with a managed democracy, i.e. a dictatorship, things work out, as that guy kept demanding they earn money, so they succeeded. They had Lee for 31 years, the guy's son is PM for 20 years = 51 years. The PAP is still in power.</p>
    <p>I don't care if you want to call them a democracy, because those terms and labels are just words, which mean very little. They claim the communists are red. But Republicans or GOP are red, so are PAP perhaps. These colors, left and right, don't mean much. Labour Party in red, Conservatives are blue. And if you choose me, you won't lose.</p>
    <p>In every other example, there has been a failure. They play musical chairs, getting kicked with a left foot, then a right foot. </p>

    <h2>We need a new constitution</h2>
    <p>This means we must adopt a new constitution.</p>
    <p>I think we have to give complete power to the president. Even Britney Spears would say we gotta trust and believe in the president. This means giving him or her as executive the authority needed over the judiciary and the legislature.</p>
    <p>Giving complete power to the judiciary is a joke. It will not work. Those people have delayed 1,000s of cases for decades. They can't do the job. </p>
    <p>They claim to be lawyers, but they will argue or fight with words, but deny everyone else the chance to take action. They hide behind "contempt of court" and "independence of judicary". They have run out of places to hide for their complete failures as an institution.</p>
    <p>The parliament of Sri Lanka, with their 225 MPs, even the unelected national list MPs can't do anything. This was promoted as a solution, but only out of hate for the Rajapaksa clan. </p>
    <p>A constitution must not be written by commentators or as a reaction by reactionaries. It must be written by a people who want to do, for a person who will do, so that they will do it.</p>
    <p>The parliament all voted unanimously for Gotabaya's chemical fertilizer ban as a majority. None of them could see the foolishness of these road to disaster strategies. </p>
    <p>Harsha De Silva saw perhaps, but the problem with democracy is they will argue, and yet, as the person hasn't got any power, they will lose as none of have the patience to die for years in the opposition.</p>
    <p>The beauty in an autocracy is that when the dictator is capable, or clever, everything works. </p>
    <p>In his short span as President, Ranasinghe Premadasa was instrumental with the textile or apparel export industry, making sure we won earnings to pay for growth.</p>
    <p>We wouldn't have been allowed to do any of that, without him, or break up unions or protestors, or stop our problems, who wish to see us all fail together, to jealously stop anyone climbing out of a well. </p>
 
    
    <h2>First article must allow me to rep our people</h2>
    <p>The first article must read I, as the head of state am granted absolute authority. It must say I, Lehan, am "never to be accused", given complete immunity to kill or steal and that I can make any decisions on business, justice or law.</p>

    <p>I'm not going to kill or steal. It just stops the drama, the making a big deal out of anything, that can arise. I am a human being, who will make mistakes. I don't want the enemy to make us look bad as a people because of my shortcomings, when you can find fault with anybody. </p>

    <p>It's just I don't want mud to be thrown at me, and by that vulgar act of insult, our Sri Lankan Flag, just because people hate our country. Having such a constitution, makes sure our people are respected the world over, in our shared identity, knowing that our head of state is respected.</p>

    <p>I want to be judged for our results. I want to be judged by my fellow people, especially at the elections. When they see the massive changes, the wealth they get to earn a share of, which they will contribute towards. All because of our dictatorship. I know they will vote for us. Like the Singaporean people chose Lee for 50 years: wishing only they could have voted Lee for 50 more.</p>
    
    <h2>I must be allowed to do my job</h2>
    <p>As long as people can attack me, they will do so, and they will keep damaging the name of Sri Lanka in the process, dividing us against each other to canabilize our good will, denying our people their best life, safety or rights, and then there is a loss incurred by everyone here. </p>
    <p>Boris Johnson got thrown out as PM because he had a Christmas party during Covid 19. People will complain about anything as you can fault anyone. You can complain about bacon being too salty as a NY Times article, or that the weather is too gloomy here, but too bright over there. </p>
    <p>What matters is when you close your eyes, and learn to quieten your mind, to judge who is with G-d and who is with the enemy, and then you decide to go with a solution to win.</p>
    
    <h2>This prevents problems from opportunists</h2>
    <p>The biggest reason why we should do so is simple. </p>
    <p>It's that this person might lead our people, to do what's best for our people. Without this power, there will be no action taken to solve any problems. </p>
    <p>Be it a court case dispute or lack of opportunity or anything else. </p>
    <p>JR started the executive presidency because there is political deadlock. There is a hung parliament when there's no majority. We would have lost the war even with 200,000 soldier versus 20,000 designated terrorists after 25 years without it. </p>
    <p>As you need to have a majority in parliament by working with, compromising and making deals with MPs to form a majority to pass a bill or budget. </p>
    <p>It's happening all over the world, in US or India or elsewhere. Over there, they have a never ending episodic drama, politicization and failings. </p>
    <p>This isn't what me or the people of SL want to see. You don't want it in Switzerland, or Singapore. Why only ruin Sri Lanka? We've had enough of it. We don't want to see debates. We want to see results. </p>
    <p>I don't care about the behind the scenes. Or a documentary about making a movie. I just want to see the final movie. I want to eat my sausage, bacon and eggs. I don't care about how pig or chicken's journey. </p>
    <p>They will argue over the most irrelevant topics. Democracies occur when people aren't given the chance to contribute fairly. We will take the action our people need to make sure we thrive.</p>
    
    <h2>We stand up for our own people</h2>
    <p>This means fighting bad people, fighting hostile foreign powers, and promoting our own people, our businesses and taking hard decisions. Without all of that power, that person or me, will not be able to do anything. They will be elected in, but having no authority, will not be able to order actions which will result in our prosperity. When a dictator tells a group of people, or a business, who is stealing: "no", it's very different from a PM who is elected in, and will tomorrow leave, as they can play some propaganda or tell some lies, to make sure of it, so their problems go away, so our people collapse, and never get up. This is already what has happened, which is why our own people aren't able to do business, earn no shares of profits and aren't able to survive.</p>
    
    <h2>The wrong people were elected previously</h2>
    <p>For a long time, some of the worst people, were empowered solely to betray the people of Sri Lanka, to rob us and to deny justice. The bad guys understand the value in giving power to a villain. This is why they win. It's time for the good people, to form a majority, and give authority to a hero. This is what it will take to win back our future.</p>
    
    <h2>Mistake made by Gota</h2>
    <p>The chemical fertilizer ban was a stupid move. It resulted in losses to Sri Lanka, making life harder for us. Gota did so as a dictator with the blessings of his academics and religious clerics.</p>
    
    <h2>Good things I will do instead</h2>
    <p>But there are good moves I can make, that I know many people will resist or oppose, which as you can find in this website as my vision. We're investing in profitable areas which some jealous losers will protest endlessly until they are prohibited. They have failed, and want everyone else to fail and be a loser too. Those will earn profits for us, and make life a lot better for all of us.</p> 
    
    <h2>Let's get the results we seek</h2>
    <p>I will need a lot of democratically granted sweeping powers over the judicary and legislature to do so. Despite what you'd think, a lot of opposition to SL exists, both within and external, and they will otherwise keep winning to deny you any way out of this hellhole. </p>
    
    <h2>I would choose another to dictate too</h2>
    <p>I proudly voted for Gotabaya Rajapaksa in 2019. He visited Thilanga's house with Dilith Jayaweera. I thought then he'd be our Lee Kuan Yew: who was Singapore's 31-year dictator. But I soon saw he wasn't using that power to better us, solve court cases and earn us money.</p>

    <h2>I am sad Gotabaya was a fool</h2>
    <p>Although I am sad to see Gotabaya wasn't able to achieve anything. I think I did my duty as a voter to choose the best option available. I think that I am mostly proud of how I gave a Sri Lankan politician or a leader the chance to develop this country. It's just a shame and now established as a fact, people like him can't do it. You need me.</p>

    <h2>Let's accept responsibility as a people</h2>
    <p>While I believe that the people of Sri Lanka as a majority, were guilty of voter irresponsibility, and took responsibility for their collective mistake by paying a painful price. Over here, and now, the people get to study my strategies carefully, make sure they make sense and then to empower me to put this into law and deploy it all. This is what makes the most sense, is morally correct as opposed to refusing to responsibility for our own actions and symbolizes our maturity as a people.</p>

    <h2>Democratic Dictator</h2>
    <p>In this democracy, you have the power to choose me and to give me the electoral authorization I need as a dictator to put our demands into law, to make sure we have freedom and achieve our aims.</p>
