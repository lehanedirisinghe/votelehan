    <h1>Standards Audit</h1>    

<p>A democracy is weak, a dictatorship is strong, it represents a strong people who are tired of arguing, doing nothing and failure, who are ready to bravely go ahead with a leader, a vision and strategy that works:</p>


        <h2>1. Strong Leadership:</h2> 
        <ul>
    <li>    Concentrating power in the executive allows for swift decision-making and policy implementation, which is crucial for rapid development and stability. This centralized authority helps in addressing issues promptly and effectively. </li>
    <li> is the reason why many start-ups with a strong leader, who is running it seriously, will thrive. I will fire any of my department leaders, whom I pick, openly if they fail to deliver results.</li>
        </ul>


<h2>2.Clear Governance Structure:</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li> Defined roles for the executive, parliament, and judiciary ensure that there is no confusion about authority and responsibilities, reducing bureaucratic delays and promoting efficient governance.  </li>

        <li> In companies with very sad democracies, management styles of being friendly, they generally have a lot of insecure drama, but mediocre results. When there is no clear boss or person in charge: it does not work.</li>
            </ul>


        <h2>3. Control Problem Immigration:</h2> 
            <ul>
        <li>  The dual-class system ensures that citizenship is granted selectively, protecting our national resources and maintaining societal balance. This prevents potential strain on resources from uncontrolled immigration.  </li> 
        <li>We are here to make sure our own people prosper, and are looked after first, and only then will we put your oxygen mask. It's time for a patriot to run the country in a way that benefits our own people.</li>
        <li>As we succeed, people will see us, and then try to come in illegally, and then even as lawful migrants, try to be citizens, who will claim the same benefits as us, when we had invested in our own people's development.</li>
        <li> We spend a fortune on educating our people properly. So we don't want to see people from elsewhere coming in to take our jobs. With our system our people will be the owners and managers, who can hire them in good conscience knowing they aren't a threat. As they will always be second class citizens.</li>
            </ul>


        <h2>4. Economic Control:</h2>             
        <ul>
        <li>Centralized management of wealth and resources helps reduce inequality and ensures that national assets are used for the collective benefit. This approach promotes equitable distribution of resources and economic growth.  </li>   
    
        <li>There are a lot of holes in our boat, where a lot of bad people have found ways to betray, leak our soul and destroy us. This fact that we are poor because there is a profit motive in our failure is proven. Unless we have a strongman we will never be able to stand up for ourselves, we will always be at each other throats, looking to betray our own people for a dollar. </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>5. Transparency and Accountability:</h2>             
        <ul>
        <li>Open communication and regular updates will keep the public informed and involved, ensuring that the system evolves based on the needs and desires of the people. </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>6. Perception of Autocracy:</h2>             
        <ul>
        <li>While significant executive power might be perceived as autocratic, the benefits of swift and effective governance outweigh this concern. We commit to maintaining transparency and accountability.</li>

        <li>Despite the American Hollywood impressions imprinted on people's psyches regarding democracies. People aren't very nice, and when given a choice, will vote wicked. They will deny human rights and cause severe pain to each other. You need to give a real leader the power to defend everyone's liberties to be themselves. </li>
        </ul>

        
        <h2>7. Citizenship Disparities:</h2>            
        <ul>
            <li>The dual-class system might be viewed as discriminatory, but it is necessary to protect national interests and resources. We will ensure that both classes of citizens have their rights and needs addressed. </li>
            <li>While we may not give the benefits we give our SLFT, this is the same in any country. Citizens pay less than PRs who pay less than foreigners in Singapore or elsewhere. We also give priority to our own now, as opposed to continuing to humiliate them.  </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>8. Judicial Independence:</h2>             
        <ul>
            <li>Although the executive can override judicial decisions, this power will be used judiciously to ensure fairness and justice. The judiciary will continue to operate independently within the framework of our constitution because our people will judge all the cases with those justice system officers only playing a role to make those decisions easier.</li>
        </ul>

        
        <h2>9. Public Trust:</h2>            
         <ul>
            <li>Building and maintaining public trust is crucial. We will prioritize transparency, communication, and inclusion to ensure that our citizens support and trust the new system.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>10. Life:</h2>            
        <ul>
            <li> People here want life, they don't wish to perish, they want to follow a leader towards prosperity, to run away from hell and despair and uncertainty, they are all sick and tired of the failings of democracy as we see in India or elsewhere, out of the 195 UN countries who are democracies.</li>
    </ul>
