tips and tricks:

we can be clever
just rewrite major topics, keeping it simple
you have a grandfather overview, father / section explained, son / individual policy strategy which works 
No orphans

when it comes to crime : 
As long as you "Claim"
This is "personal opinion"
Or that it's fair speculation
Especially based on references

LEGAL MITIGATION:
1. US or UK server
2. Force users to accept it is personal opinion
Store a cookie on IP Address
3. Use newspaper or source quotes
We should be fine to say or do anything

RISK FACTOR:
1. They can prove "malicious intent" easily
2. You struggle as it's online
3. Just ultimately hide behind "fiction" shield
4. And you can get away with anything
5. You did the nuclear bombing on FB already

Security:
We can get police help soon enough 
And some guns for our safety
so it's not such a big danger
But if they sue, drag to court 
It's easier to pin you down 
It's a bit risky
You have to avoid it 


It is wise to use:
a page internally in Votelehan.com
where we store a lot of the sources
so images and copies of it
and then it's easier to keep visitors inside
and even if more links out = good seo 
this makes it easier 

Diplomacy:
try to read as Russia or China where you invite business in
this way they do not get attacked

Palestine is a threat, but Hirshon Leave works
if the AngryPages is put up, the HL bluff will work 
This is pretty clear
They all suspect you of being a Jew, ready to shoot now
You have to worry now, or die 

Iran's two top fuckers got killed
So a Iran directed terror hit is harder to pull off
When they get killed it disrupts them
they won't be able to stage a hit for weeks 
Which gives us enough time

Anura is aware of us
likely will be directed to attack us next
We want to be clever
write a competitor analysis openly
So he is also happy to accept it

War Crimes:
We should side with our side
Claim that Russia / China is making it up
As they are pretending to be SL only friend
The folly is horrible
We should tread carefully 

Next steps: 
We need to get "experts" 
To prove or vet and approve our ideas
When it is done
All of a sudden it's scientific or serious 
There is an approval of honesty 
This goes a long way with credibility
as evidence backed or peer reviewed
We can compete on "uni world ranking"
To win out this contest with most viewers

nav: 
the footer is easy 
we might add related posts or content
but there is no need
there is a very clear funnel

CTA:
This makes sense
Very cool
We should fix it up

TO Do Texh: 
1. server (helps us, as we're not at mercy of host)
2. Web app (python3 // or c++ for stability)
3. database (postgresql)

TRUMP:
1. I think repetition is good 
2. Try to use different words/phrases for it
3. the grandfather, father, son system works
