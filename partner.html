            <h1>Partner</h1>
            <p>I'm very happy to partner you, and our people, and friends overseas to develop my native land. </p>
            <p>We welcome all people, irrespective of their unique characteristics, into our platform. This is because we are coming from a place of heaven, where everyone's understood, accepted, and their authentic self. </p>
            <p>Easy way is by buying a copy of my Vote Lehan Bible, or my book online, with your bank account details. We do make limited sales of hardcopy books over events, email or phone, which we deliver. However to contribute with an ebook: You will get a personalized, unique copy. This is a great way to support us. </p> 
            <p>We don't accept "donations". The only way to do so, is to buy something or an item, and then we accept it as a donation, but give you something of value, out of respect for you. We believe you are paying us, for a "service": leadership. </p>
            <p>I will permanently list you in my book of supporters. It's worth having your name printed as a patriot. </p>
            <p> Your contributions by buying products we sell, such as books, or affiliate marketed goods or food, our paid emails which we publish and reply to, or even services like public speaking, direct conversations or events, help make SL great. </p>
            <p>For certain figures, who represent firms or interest groups, we do accept large donations openly on record if we accept those recommendations are beneficial to SL. </p>
            <p>We use a lot of our campaign funds ("War Chest") to educate the public with real-life examples of developed vs undeveloped countries, the comparative policies used and the benefits of local implementation strategies.</p>
