                <p>You can use the form found on this page to send a message. This is the easiest way to speak to us.</p>
                <p>If the form is not visible, it may have been disabled due to an overload of requests, or your browser may have prevented it from loading.</p>
                <p>Please do not attempt to contact us in person or visit our offices without prior written approval, as this is treated as a security threat.</p>
                <p>If we do not respond, it means we either choose to refuse or ignore the request.</p>
                <p>We have deployed tools to prevent common cybersecurity abuses such as SQL injection, spam, form manipulation, and exploits.</p>
                <p>We use advanced content disarm and reconstruction (CDR) security technology to sanitize messages. The sanitized version appears in our DMZ (safe zone) as messages are often jumbled up due to security measures.</p>
                <p>Please keep your message short, under 100 words. The form's message is sent to us as an email. Email should only be used to initiate a conversation.</p>
                <p>Never send any email attachments, posts, or mail to us.</p>
                <p>We already maintain communications with key parties, relevant persons, and the media.</p>
                <p>We are not interested in any promotions, products, or unsolicited advice.</p>
                <p>In addition to the <a href="/terms.html">Terms</a>, we require further permissions from you: </p>
                <p>You must accept that we may store a <strong>permanent copy</strong> of your:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Message or contents: which are accessed by our staff in order to fulfil or escale those requests.</li> 
                    <li>Email header: which we can study with our contracted partners, who specialize in email security, even just to verify it is authentic.</li> 
                    <li>A copy of your IP address, electronic signatures, broswer or app, DNS and proxies (which we study with our contracted partners, who specialize in cyber security)</li> 
                    <li>Sensitive information: which may be detected, exposed to our ai tools, that we study with our senior team, to verify and make sense of your requests.</li> 
                    <li>Date, time, place, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Along with our internal comments: we will share with the police, lawyers or law firms, and produce openly (especially social media as we believe in transparency) or before courts or to the media when we judge it's required.</p>
                <p>We may charge fees for electronic communications to reduce spam. We will bill $10 per email before accepting it to be sent.</p>
