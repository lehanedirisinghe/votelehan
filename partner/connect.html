            <h1>Connect</h1>

            <h2>Best Way</h2>
            <p>Thank you for your interest in connecting with me. I am honored by your respect, enthusiasm, and goodwill.</p>
            <p>I apologize if this section seems standoffish; I aim to respect your time and intentions.</p>
            <p>Please try to empathize, with any respect due to you, while most leaders do not provide any access at all, I'm trying my best to create space for those who need to reach me.</p>
            <p>The best way to get in touch with me (Lehan Edirisinghe) is through my close family or friends. If you know them, please make a direct request—they’ll act when appropriate.</p>
            <p>If you don’t hear back within a week, it’s likely because I’m busy with other pressing commitments or unable to address your request.</p>

            <h2>Formal Requests</h2>
            <p>For established businesses, foreign states, officials, senior politicians, or media owners, please contact my uncles, Jagath or Thilanga. They will bring important matters to my attention.</p>
            <p>I’m very straightforward and direct. My uncles understand my views well and will filter out unsuitable requests.</p>
            <p>Feel free to also reach out to my close family, team, or other trusted individuals.</p>

            <h2>Electronic</h2>
            <p>Due to cyber security concerns, we’ve discontinued online forms and email contacts to reduce stress.</p>
            <p>We are exploring ways to charge fees ($100 at open auction) for sending emails to me. This is due to the time and responsibility involved in handling these communications. With 23 million people in Sri Lanka and 8 billion worldwide, there are many competing requests.</p>
            <p>We collect all electronic signals, calls, emails, physical meetings, and other data for internal use and potential reporting or publishing for transparency.</p>

            <h2>Lobbying</h2>
            <p>For formal lobbying, you can contact senior business leaders who advocate for better policies.</p>
            <p>I recommend joining or speaking to the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber of Young Lankan Entrepreneurs (founded by my father, Palith), or similar interest groups.</p>
            <p>Meetings with their senior lobbyists who represent business interests typically cost $10,000. As my voters believe in free, open, and honest dialogue, any conversations must be published for record-keeping purposes.</p>
            <p>Lobbying me on business matters can cost upwards of $100,000, must be done openly, and should align with my nationalist vision for a developed Sri Lanka.</p>
            <p>This is used to pay for educating the public on a national platform about the benefits. </p>

            <h2>Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep your message short: fewer than 100 words or a 2-minute executive summary.</li>
                <li>Consult with my government’s departmental experts, senior researchers, or business case studies first, as we are data-driven decision-makers.</li>
                <li>Always contact others first and only reach out to me last, and only when absolutely necessary.</li>
                <li>Understand that final decisions are made by those I appoint with formal authority, even if I take credit if it works and blame them if it doesn’t.</li>
                <li>They all follow open rules, including crowd sourcing, open bidding and SLFT + SLWF preferences.</li>
                <li>Be prepared to send a written copy of any request, as decisions are based on received documents, especially when given my office’s email (written text in the body of the email only, no attachments).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Do Not</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not contact me in person, ambush me, stalk, send post or packages, make phone calls, send SMS, request meetings, join others meeting me (you’ll be stopped), or send WhatsApp messages or emails.</li>
                <li>Unsolicited messages will not be entertained. Violating my personal space, boundaries, or safety will result in removal.</li>
                <li>I don't respond to media (don't try email), sign autographs, or take photos with you (except photos at official events, which will be mailed to you).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>While I am not looking to make any more friends, I hope to inspire you as a confident leader.</p>

            <p>The purpose of this section "Connect" is to share how I expect to communicate with cool people to achieve results.</p>
