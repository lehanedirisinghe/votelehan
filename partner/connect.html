            <h1>Connect</h1>

            <h2>Best Way</h2>

            <p>We are not accepting any communications for now.</p>

            <p>We will configure the forum or paid email later onwards when it is easier for us to do so.</p>

            <p>The 15 - 30 minutes you request might seem like a small amount of time for you, but it's a long time for me, and I don't like having the stress.</p>

            <p>Don't attempt to speak to me in person, send postage, or with any of your friends set to meet me.</p>

            <p>Please try to reach out using my close family, friends or team if you know them personally to connect.</p>

            <h2>Steps To Take First</h2>

            <p><strong>1. </strong>Talk to close friends and family. They will add weight to your request.</p>

            <p><strong>2. </strong>Try to reach out to the business as they can usually help you with this as part of customer service. (2 - 3 days)</p>

            <p><strong>3. </strong>Contact your MP Staffer to consult the MP for a solution. They are supposed to do so. (4 - 14 days)</p>

            <p><strong>4. </strong>Write to SLWF, who divert your request to the relevant market fund, who should respond. (14 - 21 days) </p>
                
            <p><strong>5. </strong>Now try to reach the relevant department's (a) staff, (b) secretaries or (c) relevant minister. (21 - 28 days) </p>

            <p>They will feel worried, as they know I will take action if there is a serious failure, so they will respond.</p>

            <p><strong>6. </strong>You should finally try the (d) department head / first minister to resolve your request. (28 - 35 days)</p>

            <p>Having failed to do so, and having collected enough written evidence or call recordings, your case makes sense.</p>

            <p>I sincerely apologize for my failures as a leader in your frustrations with the people I chose to help you.</p>

            <p>We have access to all our communications, within our gov't, our departments, and even SLWF firms, so you should feel confident that I'm on your side.</p>

            <p>You can try to speak to police, lawyers and make an online request on our courts website. This is bound to get you the results you are seeking. (35 - 42 days)</p>

            <p>Talk to 911, police, ambulance, doctors or fire rescue (or Chat GPT) if you or anyone is in urgent danger!</p>

            <p>As you have exhausted a checklist of options, prepare how you will speak to our team.</p>

            <p><strong>7. </strong>Contact my President's Office, they will receive a copy, but only when requested in writing, kindly attach proof, business case or history reports. (44 - 60 days)</p>

            <p>As democratically elected leaders, we can lose votes, and be voted out, so we are obligated to serve you.</p>

            <p>We use AI (which we have configured), to pick up certain content, to flag, and then alert us.</p>

            <p><strong>8. </strong>It will reach me if my team think it's sensible, or requires my personal attention to solve. (42 - 49 days) </p>
      
            <p>We have to publish it, you can start with, "Hi Lehan", and say your message with a few words.</p>

            <p><strong>9. </strong>You can post it on our online forum, and it will reach me if it is upvoted or requested enough. (49 - 56 days)</p>

            <p>Usually, a lot of people would be struggling with the same issue as you, so they will also demand a solution. </p>

            <p>You can try reach out to the media, journalists or bloggers, who will raise awareness, I don't mind it if you insult or deride me or my gov't out of anger.</p>

            <p>By this point, it is likely that my government is unlikely to solve your problem.</p>

            <p>There is no reason for you to give up after 2 months, you can try to run for elections next! </p>

            <p>All of the above 9 are steps you can take for free, especially if within reason or a serious matter.</p>

            <p>Finally, there is a paid option to correspond with perhaps the only world leader out of 195 serving 8 billion. </p>

            <p><strong>10. </strong>Email me for $1,000 (auction bid for 20/ week) minus SLFT income tier discounts applying. (7 - 21 days)</p>

            <p>The paywall price of an email may skyrocket up to $10,000 or more by demand to discourage wasting my time. </p>

            <p>As there are 23m citizens, it's hard to respond, so please accept my best wishes achieving a solution.</p>

            <p>I won't take more than 1 hour or 60 minutes / 20 emails = 3 minutes on your request, if it takes longer than 1 minute to read, I will have 2 minutes to take action. </p>

            <p>I don't care about you: use less than 50 words to convey what you want with a clear, specific request. </p>

            <p>I most likely won't refund you, but yes, I might even recognize you publicly with my thanks.</p>

            <p>I likely would have to fire or reassign leaders, change policies or adapt our department strategies.</p>

            <p>Prices are high as is it is top level access, serious business and is read by me as executive.</p>

            <p>Please do me a favor and ask those other people, who are supposed to do it for you, to do it first.</p>

            <p>It should not be you ask the chairperson of McDonald's to help you order a BigMac when front staff should.</p>

            <p>I selected the top people for our teams, so they be able to solve anything for you.</p>
