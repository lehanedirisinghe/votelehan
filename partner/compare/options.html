            <h1>Options</h1>
            <p>Over here I share assessments of options whom we can vote for to run SL on our behalf.</p>
        </section>

    <section id="lehan-e">
        <h2>0. Lehan Edirisinghe</h2>
        <p>This is my own self-assessment. It's biased. </p>
        <h3>Usefulness</h3>
        <p>I am a transparent leader with a good strategy for all the departments of my executive government and the two arms of government: parliament and courts, to serve our people. </p>
        <p>We show good, entertaining journal keeping on how I am thinking. </p>
        <p> There is a good ambitious SLWF strategy, together with a creative, inclusive SLFT program. This is all very different from the other politicians. </p>
        <p>There is no emphasis or requiring of persons to depend on me or ask me for things which is a source of relief.</p> 
        <p>We can transform SL, and trasfigure our society. We leverage modern tools, skills and applied strategies to do so.</p>
        <h3>Drawbacks</h3>
        <p>Sri Lanka's a divided, factional nation. There is a lot of lobbying demand for bad policies or businesses. Particularly by vocal groups who don't know how a country should be governed. The corrupt culture of SL has been destructive to many people.</p>
        <p> I worry there will be "resistance" by the established business people, who will get support from the overwhelming majority of people here, against me. </p>
        <p>They will all say my ideas of doing "unethical, bad karma" generating businesses which Siddhartha Gautama's banned, is wrong, or immoral: I will be rejected from society, lose the election and someone else will win the vote.</p>
        <p>They will then continue on the destructive path to failure SL is on, as they will be representing the people's will to do so.</p>
        <h3>Self-conclusions</h3>
        <p>A lot of people have given up on the people of Sri Lanka, by ruling that "hey this is Sri Lanka". They mean that the people are the problem, are a hopeless lost case, and it's better to play along, leave or go do something else.</p>
        <p>As failure and resulting frustration has become institutionalized as an integral part of our SL system, fabric and identity. We're not just an underdog, it's a pale horse in a horse race, where we are unlikely at all to win.</p>
        <p>However, I have confidence that the people here, will hear my message, will think for themselves, and become the solutions they seek themselves by voting for me. It represents modernity. With enough campaigning, we can win our election.</p>
        <h3>Uncertainty</h3>
        <p>It's like someone from a developed country has shown up. Has identified problems, and has come up with a proposal to be the dictator, to apply solutions.</p>
        <p>These solutions are all systems and strategies that work in developed countries. But those are predominatly either Christian or secular states. Plus white or Asian Yellow. They are accepting of those systems that work.</p>
        <p>The best outcome is we're accepted, the wrong outcome is we're rejected, and then the people fail, and some of them escape to a developed country which does what I tried to do here. So they are able to thrive, be free and happy.</p>
    </section>

        <section id="ranil-w">
            <h2>1. Ranil Wickramsinghe</h2>
            <p>After several terms as PM of a failed state. While inflation is still worse than it was with Gota. He has cut imports, stopped protests, etc. He is now asking to be president. But there is no clear vision of what this entails.</p>

            <h3>Value</h3>
            <p>He is a mature, stable and professional leader. He has decades of insight, often as a leader, to guide his moves. He is very likely to have written a better history from 2005 for us, had he won the election against Mahinda Rajapaksa. He stepped up, bravely to face the challenge our country faced, scorned and covered with scars, with 1 out of 225 MP seats, and he was able to secure our people's sense of life. He has patience, strong values and is respected by everyone here for he respects them. He has even helped me see Lee Hsien Loong once, which is nice of him. He will position us well, better than alternatives, but we would have to do everything to make the most of it.</p>

            <h3>Trouble</h3>
            <p>In addition to being quite unpatriotic. He has failed to understand SL's problems are structural. These problems we have are in-built fail-sure mechanisms. These problems require a bold, courageous and ambitious leader who will face them head on. Sometimes getting along with bad people, when things are going wrong, is not a strength, but a weakness. Theoretical grasp of free market policies aren't enough. You need to be able to show pragmatic decision making, very directly. The free market isn't going to bode well for us, we can't survive as a small country, we will need to be clever. You will need to show real leadership, by not playing it safe.</p>

            <h3>Mismatch</h3> 
            <p>A real leader has to first make sure the industries here are booming, so there is a domestic economy. This means standing up to the lobby of the monks preaching Right Livelihood. It means bringing real criminals who steal to justice, not Jerome Fernando for preaching his faith in Christ to his audience. Although Ranil saw public finances are "cooked", he has done nothing, he's lied about people being fed when 20% starve in a man-made disaster. If he came to a developed country, asking to be PM or President there, they'd see in his CV he was PM mutliple times in a disaster nation. Be a hero the developed world will come to, and then we're already there ourselves. </p>
        </section>    

        <section id="anura-k">
            <h2>2. Anura Kumara Dissanayake</h2>
            <p>He has got a lot of attention finding fault. He won a lot of respect for having done so. However, he hasn't proposed any solutions. He isn't even revealing clearly what his communist utopia will look like for 99 of us.</p>

            <h3>The Good</h3>
            <p>While many will say communism doesn't work. It has evolved, with state capitalist China, and some say Singapore too. They pay for socialist objectives with funds acquired from free market principles such as efficiency in Singapore. China in a short time was able to conquer the whole world, while India is a derailed train wreck in perpetuity as a democracy. The truth has dawned on us all that the man is one of the most honest, humble and serious. He has got not just vision in his mind, but love like Che in his heart, and a rebel spirit like we saw when any nation overthrew their colonial masters or their puppet appointees.</p>

            <h3>The Bad</h3>
            <p>While I might have strong plans. Some of them are far-fetched, likely to result in aversion from destractors. I still share them. Anura doesn't. This is something that does make us feel worried, as we would rather know where we are headed. The 9/11 hijackers may very well have lied on their way to Islamic Jihad paradise. So it doesn't fully matter. However, his momentum will soon run out, with his popularity free-falling to 25%. As people are worried he wouldn't honor debts to BlackRock as he claims, despite SL entering those agreements with lenders.</p>

            <h3>The Ugly</h3>
            <p>While I won't call him a "comrade" as I dislike communism. I just don't believe in centrally planned government. I believe in rights, success and freedom of the individual. I will be proud to call him my comrade in arms, as I see a patriot. I would fight by his side. But not if he wants to rob our people's right to own stuff, to pay the state.  It's then a sibling rivalry. As he's not educated properly, they often say they don't understand or disagree, when a sophisticated issue, for lack of cultural exposure. It's wrong when untrained doctors who can't treat patients are deciding.</p>

            <h3>The Pretty Penny</h3>
            <p>There is a big risk, that the same slip into the left, which we saw from UNP Ranasinghe Premadasa to PA Chandrika Kumaratunga, then more to left with Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sirisena and Gotabaya, will culminate in our ruination. As they expect the people to trust the gov't more, to pay more in taxes, to surrender rights, to not have property rights or rights to engage in business freely or invest. Commies expect all 99 out of 100 to bow down before Anura to be allowed to do business, for bigger "needs" handouts, as he turns into Joseph Stalin, a communist dictator. </p>
        </section>    

        <section id="dhammika-p">
            <h2>3. Dhammika Perera</h2>
            <h3>Personal Remarks:</h3>
            <p>After becoming the richest man in one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Where he is seen with the Rajapaksas often, with his partner. He has decided that SL is lacking dollars, he has proposed we earn some with some superficial business plans. He also claims he will stop corruption. However there is so much lacking in the way of satisfying our people's dreams.</p>

            <h3>Plus Points</h3>
            <p>He's got a good enough vision, which is undoubtedly pragmatic. He is a Sinhalese who has succeeded despite the odds stacked against him. He played by the rules our people gave him, instead of fighting them, he was able to thrive. He without any doubt, a true patriot, a son or father of the soil, who has been a one man trade delegation show wherever he went. He is a king of our people, who is someone people anywhere will accept. Vincent Norman Peale would love his sense of positivity. He was innovative, learning in Taiwan how to build a slot machine, which won him his fortune. As Hindu Jain inspired Siddhartha Gautama (Buddhist founder) didn't feel then 2,500 years ago that gambling was a form of slavery, he didn't ban it. So he is a devout buddhist patron.</p>

            <h3>Minuses</h3>
            <p>While unelected Investment Promotion minister (taking Basil Rajapaksa's MP seat), he found out that nobody wants to invest here. Unless that FDI is highly crooked, at loss to our own. The hard truth here is that nobody likes SL. They don't want to invest here as it's not a safe place. Put simply: there are no real courts, no sense of confidence internally or externally, and too many negative news reports.</p>
        </section>    

        <section id="hans-w">
            <h2>4. Hans Wijayasuriya</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>After successfully helping Malaysia's Axiata make massive returns after investing $1.5b in SL once. Over $600 million dollars per year to do what Sri Lanka Telecom does. He has according to Gota got political ambitions for making a request for information; I think perhaps when he was our premier lobbyist Ceylon Chamber of Commerce chairperson as well.</p>

            <h3>Advantages</h3>
            <p>He is a gentleman. He is kind, clever and works tirelessly for others with little self-regard. He shows compassion, empathy and humility. He gave me my (passed away) dad's old phone number. He has a good intellectual perspective, which is grounded on facts, and he is an asset to any team blessed with him. I see him as one of the most intelligent Sinhalese we have.</p>

            <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
            <p>He is unpatriotic. Dialog Axiata is a Malaysian firm, and they are making off with $600m dollars or more per year. This kind of blood-loss will faint out people, put our dreams in a coma and kill us in our sleep--if we're not going to wake up. Plus when I angrily told him a British firm asked us to lobby him, he ignored it. Our people want a real human being, and a hero.</p>

        </section>    

        <section id="chamath-p">
            <h2>5. Chamath Palihapitiya</h2>
            <h3>Personal Remarks</h3>
            <p>Honestly: I like Chamath so much, I'd vote for him. He is a SL citizen. But the problem is he hasn't got as good a vision for what he would like Sri Lanka to be. </p>
            <p>This lack of a clear vision is lacking. I propose total change which I believe in. I can invite him as my first finance minister (which is the big one).</p>

            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <p>He's someone who saw FB wasn't healthy, pointed it out. He has invested SPACs with great care for ethics to build returns. There will always be naysayers and critics. So people will condemn him on his Wikipedia. As public figures, anyone who can think of a cruel thing to write will do so. </p>
            <p>If I could be any Sinhalese, I would choose to be him. He is a very cool person. Whom I admire. He's got great intuition, charm and character. He's like Upali Wijewardene.</p>

            <h3>More Good</h3>
            <p>Chamath is now supporting Donald Trump's candidacy, after first pitching phoney Vivek Ramaswamy. I saw Vivek quickly give up when Trump attacked him.</p>
            <p>We were struggling with Biden-Harris foreign policy. When Harris says they don't like SL, the US, their state department and US firms all say so as well. </p>
            <p>So, as a Sinhalese race, who represent Sri Lanka for the most part and as human beings who care for each other: we all are deeply appreciative of a Trump presidency. He is friends with several cool people in the USA.</p>

            <h3>Cons</h3>
            <p>He hasn't been here to see what's going on. There are many systematic breakdowns. Which are so deep, structural and iceberg-like, not merely skeletons buried, that it's not as easy as it seems to fix this place.</p>
    
            <p> This is perhaps a good thing as he has a will to improve things here--after escaping hell whereas everyone else has already completely given up.</p>

        </section>    

        <section id="dilith-j">
            <h2>6. Dilith Jayaweera</h2>
            <p>After running Gotabaya's 2019 campaign, he was in trouble as Gota screwed up badly. Some lied he had secured "business deals" using Gota to make a lot of money. I think jealous people lie. I haven't seen the evidence. </p>
            <p>Dilith has started a political party recently (I like how he doesn't give up), loves favorable attention, has a news channel Derana TV, and is indeed very patriotic, handsome and Sinhalese chauvinist. </p>
            <p> However does seem afraid of what people think of him, hasn't got a vision any better than Gota's and isn't his truly authentic self as he's living in fear of judgement. </p>
            <p>Trouble with such candidates is while they can see Singapore's successful or ranking well, and may see what they are doing, but will not superimpose what works into our country. </p>
            <p>The Sri Lanka Can attitude is very healthy. But the standards are foreboding. You have to start by saying the era of This Is Sri Lanka is long gone now. We want SL to mean positive things like high trust society, prosperity or freedom. </p>
        </section>    



        <section id="sajith-p">
            <h2>7. Sajith Premadasa</h2>
            <h3>Good News</h3>
            <p>He represents a balanced option between Ranil and Anura. He has a fairly good vision. He has demonstrated good-will towards all, winning over friends and foes. He crushed Ranil at the elections after 4/21 in 2019. I saw his socially progressive stance, which I believe Jalani has advocated as women's rights. When I was taking a three-wheel taxi to visit my aunt's house. I spoke to the driver, and said Sajith's a good option. To my dismay, these people were saying that Sajith's shameless. He is talking about tampons in public, which reveals how backward our society is. A lot of people never gave Sajith a chance. In any developed country, Sajith would have beaten Gotabaya very easily. As those people are very demanding, have mature societies and advanced economies which rely on the private sector.</p>

            <h3>Bad News</h3>
            <p>He has a sister Dulanjali who is pushing journalists around. When people die, nobody says the bad. But sometimes, you got to take the good with the bad. The world has changed, and we have to impress modern audiences with our own achievements. We have to stand on our own two feet when judged. A lot of people have already tried to make him look bad, so he can't stand on his own. Ranil is claiming that he is a better presidential candidate, and has repeated this lie. But he was rejected, with 1 seat, whereas Sajith built his own party from scratch and won a lot of votes despite the 4/21 attacks or bond scam Ranil had been accused of. A lot of Sajith's MPs are even now the backbone of Ranil's otherwise completely Gota SLPP MP roster.</p>
        </section>    

        <section id="namal-r">
            <h2>8. Namal Rajapaksa</h2>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <p>He is patriotic. He is a Sinhalese, who represents our culture proudly. He is sincere, loyal and sees the best in people. He has a humanist appeal which is genuine in his love of SL. I think he is someone who embody's a spirit of friendship, charisma and humility. I think he would have done far better than Gotabaya, had Dilith helped Namal, a younger leader to do so. He appeals to wide sections of society with his authenticity, patriotism and proudly Sinhalese traditionalist identity. </p>
            
            <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
            <p>The culture is totally corrupt, the guy's got many nice watches, lies about his salary. He's a prince of the This is Sri Lanka cult, just as much as he's a Sinhalese kumaraya. He is trusting of some bad people who have betrayed and set him down the wrong path. They have brought out the worst in this great family, making them look like fools, and achieved their own ulterior goals by trying to work together to destroy the strong Rajapaksa family.</p>
        </section>    

        <section id="shavendra-s">
            <h2>9. Shavendra Silva</h2>
            <h3>Strongsuit</h3>
            <p>He has adhered to the traditions, code of honor and societal expectations passed down to him. He has shown strong will, discipline and good tempered judgement. He is a hero to a lot of people here, and not just a war hero, but a celebrity who is celebrated as a real-life gladiator like Russell Crowe. When I see Shavendra with Sujeewa Nelson, I hear Hans Zimmer's music with Lisa Gerrard's vocals. Many people here are loyal to him. He has built armored personnel carriers which is very industrious of him. This showed me that when given the opportunity, our own people can build cool products, which I see as a path to self-sustainability. He is also respected by army leaders in many countries.</p>

            <h3>Weakpoints</h3>
            <p>He was treated like a servant or security guard, and barked orders by a lunatic. While SL Army was fighting war crimes allegations, a maniac was heard demanding he murder protesting civilians (on live tv). When the time came, Shav always did what's best for SL. In the fight against thievery, his track record leaves too much room for improvement, and we can't win this safely from behind the artilery line. I disagree with buddhist perspective on defense, to not make "offensive weapons" or armaments, which I'm angry he's accepted despite his own close encounters with death because of terrorists. This time, our fight, our war is within us, and we have to conquer ourselves to rule the world. </p>

            <h2>10. Sarath Fonseka</h2>
            <h3>Plus Bullet Points</h3>
            <p>He fought the Rajapaksas over corruption. He was the field marshall who had won the war. I saw him in parliament, shook hands with him, his wife Anoma was there. However, Sirisena stole his thunder, and with his Ranil for good governance ploy, did not do much for the people. I have no doubts about how, if Sarath Fonseka had won instead of Sirisena: Sarath would have personally led the daring raid on Zahran's compound.</p>

            <h3>Bad Bullet Points</h3>
            <p>Like Shavendra, and like Gotabaya. There has to be more to Sri Lanka than just killing a bunch of Tamil rebels who were angry they couldn't survive here over being denied the right to access our economy when speaking Tamil language. Over here, brains over brawn, are valued, as nukes or artillery are more lethal than infantry at winning conflicts. He can do it. Empower the right people on your team to win this.</p>
