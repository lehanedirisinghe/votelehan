    <h1>Solutions</h1>
    <p>An election is about solutions. We want to defeat the "This Is Sri Lanka" cult.</p>

    <h2>Identifying Traits</h2>
    <p>This evil group is led by gangsters who fund politicians. The enemy claim to be part of, and promote, a corrupted, harmful version of Theravada Buddhism. They systematically harm the innocent, young, foreigners, minorities, and women.</p>
    
    <h2>Misguided Democracy</h2>
    <p>Sri Lanka’s kleptocracy gives you two options. This is either: a communist oligarchy or crony capitalism. These are your only options. You must suck up to the criminal higher ups, make friends with and beg for favors. This is the only way to get a job, get anything done or to succeed here in Sri Lanka.</p>
    
    <h2>Wasted Elections</h2>
    <p>We have elections every 5 years. We see capitalists and socialists switch seats. But our country always loses. It’s like musical chairs, a merry-go-round.</p>   
    
    <p>This destroys the respect people have for democracy. As it clearly doesn’t work. These politicians don’t know political economic theories. Ranil’s UNP, Sirisena’s SLFP, Sajith’s SJB or Gotabaya’s SLPP: they’re colluding as friends. They have each other’s backs. They’re as thick as thieves. You see how friendly they are with each other.</p>

    <p>When you read or listen to the politicians, they never discuss the serious problems we face. You see how little intelligence they possess.
    </p>
    
    <p>There’s no accountability for budget expenses, decisions or governmental performance. These criminals depend on our people being poor, needing their help or being left in the dark to control them. As they only have power if they can extort votes.</p>    
    
    <p>Often the political parties exist only to divide and confuse the voters.</p>   

        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p><a href="/problems/bad-leaders.html">Bad Leaders</a>: It hurts to accept responsibility, for collective mistakes when selecting from a few horrid decision makers. It's time to finally break free from this cycle of hell.</p>

        <p>Solution: Vote Lehan. We will run the country properly. This is not just a historical moment as a nation. It's not just a new chapter. This is a new book we're writing as a people.</p>
            
        <p><a href="/problems/hostile-countries.html">Hostile Countries</a>: Pariah states control the regional neighborhood, picking incapable leaders to rule us by proxy. Your vote means we rise up to win back our island.</p>

        <p>Solution: Vote Lehan. We will make good deals with anyone, as long as it's open, good faith and profitable, where our people prosper with sustainability, ethics and fair offerings: we will do it.</p>
        
        <p><a href="/problems/evil-racketeers.html">Evil Racketeers</a>: Big profits in Sri Lanka's failure, ensured our people's collapse. All my designs grow our fortunes.</p>
    
        <p>Solution: Vote Lehan. You will get to invest freely in any of the profitable industries. No racketeers, thugs or any threats will be able to game Sri Lanka to their crooked advantage while harming our people any further. Those who make it here, can't make it anywhere else, as they'd go to jail. But soon, you will see you can achieve your dreams here, with your friends, hard work and attitude. </p>

        <p><a href="/problems/fake-buddhist.html">Fake Buddhist</a>: A faith system designed to make people free of suffering, twisted to justify misery. Many prayers will soon be answered when we wake up.</p>
    
        <p>Solution: Vote Lehan. We will make sure that theravada and mahayana buddhism is united, that our Sinhalese people adhering to Siddhartha Gautama's teachings are shepherded to better pastures. We will be free of want as an extinguishing of the cravings behind suffering, not for a lack of unsatisfied want as a cause of pain we see. We will see many of the spiritual drawn to us for our ethical pragmatism, realistic sense of faith and heaven's wisdom. </p>

        <p><a href="/problems/weak-courts.html">Weak Courts</a>: Corruption, theft, everywhere. No court cases to be done any time soon. How about we reach Denmark's court benchmark?</p>
    
        <p>Solution: Vote Lehan. We will make sure our courts go from the most disgraced the world over, to the gold in Mount Olympus' gates benchmark, the new standard who every nation aspire to. Every man, woman and child here will say, let's settle it in court, at the first sign of trouble, knowing we will answer their call.</p>

        <p><a href="/problems/low-standards.html">Low Standards</a>: From food, to education, to health, the poverty trap hits us all. We're sick of compromising. We believe you will do what's best from a position of strength, comfort and ease.</p>

        <p>Solution: Vote Lehan. A lot of what Sri Lanka has to offer, their very best, is unacceptably inferior. Virtually everything sucks. But with good leadership, by teaching our people and showing them the way, by showing the best examples of winners to aspire to, rather than justify our mediocrity by comparing with the lowest losers. Everyone here will feel the impact of our actions.</p>
    
        <p><a href="/problems/beggar-nation.html">Beggar Nation</a>: From $1 = Rs 3.77 to Rs 300: We have tumbled downhill over the last 70 years to poverty. It's time to start acting like a republic, not an unsightly failure.</p>

        <p>Solution: Vote Lehan. All of our policies, every law, every decision, it's only ever been spoken after jumping through the hoops used by the best businesses in the world. Profitability is in every word we utter. This country will be a very rich country, and our people will be kings and queens. The last of the world, blessed in their meekness, will inherit everything, as the first.</p>

        <p> <a href="/problems/dying-sinhalese.html">Dying Sinhalese</a>: Disaster status despite paying $ billions in taxes. Every failure contributes to the systematic replacement of our Sinhalese. It's time to give our people life.</p>

        <p>Solution: Vote Lehan. Our Sinhalese will be our homeland, you will all soon be the masters of this country who will take the whip from anyone no more. You will all decide your own destiny, which you will all look very much forward to enjoying.</p>
