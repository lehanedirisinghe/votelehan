            <p>We are a for-profit business. This is because we don't believe in asking for donations. This is because I believe Sri Lanka's a failure because of a beggar psyche.</p>
            <p>We accept contributions, in exchange for providing you with some momento. This could be a book, even an e-book, to permanently list you on our honor roll or give you a gift of merchandise, art or thing of value.</p>
            <p>There is a lot of close relevance between national leadership and the business of a country. We are happy to make sure our people, especially our supporters, are able to thrive economically with our close support.</p>
            <p>Every large corporation in the world, enjoyed close patronage from their government leaders. Most of big tech maintain ties with DOD, all the defense firms have just one major customer: the Pentagon, even the Nazis helped their German firms.</p>
            <p>As we wish to expand opportunity meaningfully, we are playing a pivotal role in making sure our nation thrives.</p>
            <p>Sri Lanka failed for decades as it's profitable to derail us as a people; and as such, we shall only rise when there is a profit motive in our success.</p>
